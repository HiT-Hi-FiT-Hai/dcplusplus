/// A class to position objects in a rectangular area.
/** \ingroup WidgetLayout
  * You start by using one of the setBoundsBorders calls to establish the rectangular
  * area. This call gives you the option of setting x and y borders around the
  * objects.
  *
  * The size of the objects are assumed to be known, but you can use sizeOfCell to
  * calculate what the size of an object should be to fit perfectly into a grid
  * arrangement in the area.
  *
  * Then you use  positionToRight( struct Rectangle & obj ), passing only the
  * obj.size, and receiving the calculated obj.pos. This gives a rectangle suitable
  * for the AspectSizable functions.
  *
  * positionToRight's layout approach is left to right until the next line of objects
  * starts just below the previous line.
  *
  * These optional functions let you customize the placement operation: <br>
  * void newRow() <br>
  * void tabTo( double xfract ) <br>
  * void sizeForRemainingSpace( struct Rectangle &obj )
  *
  * positionBelow() and newCol() are similar functions in case you want to layout a
  * column of objects
