  * A coolbar is a strip of buttons normally associated with menu commands, like  for 
  * instance Internet Explorer has ( unless you have made them invisible ) a toolbar 
  * of buttons, one for going "home", one to stop rendering of the  current page, one 
  * to view the log of URL's you have been to etc... In addition to serving like a 
  * dockable toolbar ( see ToolBar ) a Coolbar  Widget can also contain more 
  * complex Widgets lke for instance a ComboBox, a TextBox and so on...   
  * 
  * @todo This class needs some love...
