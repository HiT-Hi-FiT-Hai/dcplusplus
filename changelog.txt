* Fixed upload slots bug
* Fixed download resume bug
* Fixed security bug (allowing people to download arbitrary files on the hd...thanx Simon E.)
* Added new settings dialog
* Added client version option
* Added rollback size option
* Added auto-follow redirects option
* Removed some level 4 warnings when compiling
* Almost made compatible with VC++ 7.0 (You still have to change one line in the WTL to compile due to changes in ATL...)
* Fixed some performance issues with large download queues (the app was doing a lot of unnecessary saving...). This should also
  solve the problems people have had with unsaved settings...
* Corrected transfer list display (Offline/Online users)
* Added search flood detection (If more than 5 searches are received from the same user within 7 seconds, DC++ will send
  out a warning)
* Added /dc++, /search <string>, /slots #, /refresh and /join <hub> commands to the main chat
* Enabled multi-line messages in chat and in pm window

* Because of a design flaw in the original dc client, I had to remove the small files and dc list extra slots
  feature for original dc users, but hey, it's their loss really (there's a problem with file listings closing
  just because "no free slots" is reported as soon as they try to download)
* Fixed a private message crash
* Added automatic saves every time the download list changes (now you only have to hope it doesn't crash while saving...=)
* Added notepad (stupid feature really, what's wrong with windows' notepad?) (only visible in menu so far...)
* Fixed missing close button on pm window (I think...can't find a window without at least...)

* Files smaller than 16k and file lists are now downloaded before any larger ones from the same user
* More work on the multihub feature

* Fixed search bug
* Hopefully fixed download bug, please report...

 -- 0.121 2002-01-15 --
* Fixed resume bug
* Fixed rollback bug
* Fixed upload slots bug
* Fixed some minor download queue bugs
* Tried a different approach to the download problems in 0.12. When implementing different user nicks on different hubs,
  I had to change some of the download code to something that I'm not sure will work with the original client,
  that's why you've had so many problems with 0.12. Please remember that this is still alpha software, and that
  I release these versions this frequently so that 1) you have the latest of the latest and 2) so that I have someone
  who does the testing for me to speed up development...anyway, keep on reporting them bugs and one day, they will be gone!!

* Changed background color to white (or whatever you have as window color), don't worry though, soon you'll be able to choose it yourselves...

* Added a separator between each user in the transfer right button menu (I'll do something better later on...)
* Added some keyboard shortcuts
* Public hubs automatically appears on startup
* Thanks for all the bug reports and feature request, keep on adding them!
