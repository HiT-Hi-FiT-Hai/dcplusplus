* Improved search efficiency a tiny bit
* Changed default option in the search window to 'At Least'. All files are at least 0 bytes long anyway...
* Added file extension field in the search frame
* Fixed a bug where the application could stop working if a right-button menu was displayed
* Added PM and browse file list to uploads right button menu as well
* Huge performance increase in the user list (most noticeable when connecting to the hub and getting the initial list...)
* More general ui performance fixes, it should now be a lot more responsive even when the cpu load is significant
* Fixed empty search fields bug (I hope...)
* Fixed some of the random crashes (major code rewrite, so I might have introduced some new ones...we'll see=)
* Changed background color to white, don't worry though, soon you'll be able to choose it yourselves...
* Fixed case of connection type strings
* The bots are now visible in the user list (Seems like they don't answer to getinfo requests...)
* Added user connection type to search frame
* New icons and colors for the user interface
* Fixed menu bug for NT4, hopefully it works in W95 as well now...

* Fixed search filtering bug

* Added a separator between each user in the transfer right button menu (I'll do something better later on...)
* Added some keyboard shortcuts
* Public hubs automatically appears on startup
* Thanks for all the bug reports and feature request, keep on adding them!
