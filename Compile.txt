How to compile in 4 easy steps:

1) Make sure you've downloaded the WTL 7.0 Package and have all the files in it in your include path
   You can find it on the dc++ sourceforge site. Mind the version.

2) Make sure you have stlport 4.5.3 installed and that it's included _before_ the standard vc directories
   Use the one supplied on the dc++ sourceforge page (do not use the one from www.stlport.org unless 
   you know what you're doing). Mind the version.

3) Make sure you have a fairly recent platform sdk (November 2001 or newer has worked for me)
   The sdk is freely available from ms: http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/
   You need the core sdk at least (not the 64-bit edition...)
   Make sure that this sdk is included _before_ the standard vc directories.

4) Open the project workspace and press your build button.

Note; you'll probably get a whole bunch of warnings, ignore those, it's a bug in the compiler...
Note 2; I usually use vs.net, but I try to keep it vs6 compatible as well...

By the way, with doxygen, graphviz and some luck you can use the supplied doxygen configuration file
to generate some nice docs...just check that the paths in doxyfile are correct (graphviz)...
