The most important thing about compiling: If it didn't work, *you* screwed up.

How to compile in x easy steps:

1a) Either install Mingw from www.mingw.org
   - You'll need w32api, gcc and g++ (with dependencies), see their site for installation instructions
   - You'll also have to install STLport later on
   - Make sure gcc/g++ is in your path and before any cygwin installation
   
1b) or install Microsoft Visual C++ 8.0 (I don't use it so there might be minor compile problems)
   - If you get errors about a missing file "natupnp.h", you need a more recent platform SDK - google.
   - Make sure cl is in your path (open a VS command prompt when building)

2) Install the most recent development release of SCons (www.scons.org) and make sure you have it in your PATH

3) Download and unzip STLport in the stlport folder, and install it so that the compiled libraries end up in 
   stlport/lib. This step is optional when using MSVC++.

4) Open a command prompt and type "scons" followed by some options:
	"tools=mingw" - Use mingw for building (default)
	"tools=default" - Use msvc for building (yes, the option value is strange)
	"mode=debug" - Compile a debug build (default)
	"mode=release" - Compile an optimized release build

Note;	If you have problems, read the forum posts before posting. Somebody else has probably made your 
	mistake already. The word to note in the last sentence is 'your', so let me articulate a bit more,
	it works on my computer, so it's yours that is not correctly set up.

By the way, with doxygen, graphviz and some luck you can use the supplied doxygen configuration file
to generate some nice docs...just check that the paths in doxyfile are correct (graphviz)...

Linux / Unix:
Look at linuxdcpp.berlios.de for the *nix port of DC++ - they'll gladly accept any help. 

Submitting patches

If you think you've done something that more people could use, you can always submit a patch for inclusion in the
original distribution. I will then consider whether I like the patch or not based on things that might seem to be 
completely random, which just might be the case. Popular reasons for rejecting a patch include, but are not limited to,
ugly code, abusable features, feature that I don't like that bloat the application and incompatibility with other 
modifications I've already done. 

To increase the chances of your patch being accepted, do like this:
1) Check out the latest code from SVN (see http://sf.net/projects/dcplusplus for instructions)
2) Make your modification. If you make other modifications apart from the one you want to submit, do them
   on a separate copy of the DC++ source code and then copy them to this folder.
3) In the source root folder (the one with this file in it) do "svn diff > my-patch.diff".
4) Post the file in the DC++ bugzilla (don't forget to hand over copyright, see below).

By submitting a patch, you agree to that I get copyright of it. This to avoid stupid situations later on where
the copyright is split out over a million people, each of which could stop further distribution of DC++, and also
to make it easier for us to defend the gpl against violators. If you don't like this policy, start your own 
distribution, if you're lucky it might become more popular than the original =). Please
state explicitly in the bugzilla that you give me copyright over the code if the submission is larger than trivial.
