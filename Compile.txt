How to compile in 4 easy steps:

1) Make sure you've downloaded the WTL 7.0 Package and have all the files in it in your include path
2) Make sure you have stlport 4.5.3 installed and that it's included _before_ the standard vc directories
3) Make sure you have a fairly recent platform sdk (I'm currently using the November 2001 release)
   The sdk is freely available from ms: http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/
   Make sure that this sdk is include _before_ the standard vc directories.
4) Open the project workspace and press your build button.

Note; you'll probably get a tonne of warnings, ignore those, it's a bug in the compiler...
