  * Class for creating a Status Bar Control. <br>
  * A status bar is a status info line normally residing in the bottom of a
  * Window or other container type of Widget. <br>
  * You can then send text to that window to show e.g. "status info" regarding the
  * Window which owns the Status Bar Control. A good example of an application
  * with a status bar is for instance Internet Explorer which ( unless you have made
  * it invisible ) has a strip of status information at the bottom showing for
  * instance the security settings of the current page and how far in the download
  * process you are currently etc... <br>
  * Note that there are TWO DIFFERENT status bar controls though, one which does have
  * "sections" which sub divide< TypeOfStatusBar >s the status bar into several smaller sections which
  * are independant of eachother and another type which is a "flat strip" containing
  * only one large portion of text. <br>
  * The default one is the flat one, use Section as the last template parameter to
  * use the one with sections!
