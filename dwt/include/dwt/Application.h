  * To get to the Application object use the static member function
  * Application::instance() <br>
  * The Application object contains several useful functions, e.g. the getModulePath
  * and the getCommandLine functions which in turn loads a bitmap and returns the
  * handle to it, retrieves the path to the physical directory of the exe file and
  * retrieves a vector of command line parameters. <br>
  * The Application class inherits from boost::noncopyable to indicate it's not to be
  * copied
