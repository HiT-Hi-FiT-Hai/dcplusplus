/// Aspect class used by Widgets that have the possibility of setting and getting a
/// "size" property of their objects.
/** E.g. the TextBox have a "size" Aspect therefore it realizes the
  * AspectMinMax through inheritance. <br>
  * Note! <br>
  * All coordinates have zenith top-left corner of either the desktop display or the
  * client area of the parent Widget. <br>
  * Note! <br>
  * There are two different ways to calculate the position of a Widget, one is in
  * screen coordinates which starts top left of the desktop window, the other way is
  * relative to its parent Widget which starts at the top left of the parent Widgets
  * client area which is the total area of the Widget after the border, menu, toolbar
  * etc have been taken away. <br>
  * In addition all bounding Rectangles dealt with through this class are giving
  * their down right coordinates in SIZES and not in POSITIONS!
