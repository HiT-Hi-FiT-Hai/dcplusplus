/// Class for helping loading of libraries or dlls
/** Class normally meant for internal usage but can also be used publicly in user
  * code. <br>
  * Usage is whenever you need to ensure a dll is loaded instantiate a static object
  * of this type, static to ensure Constructor is only called upon the first
  * roundtrip of that code! <br>
  * Then if that library is not loaded somewhere earlier in some other portions of
  * your code it will load that library on demand the first time you need it! <br>
  * Class is thread safe to ensure safe usage across multiple threads! Though if you
  * need explicitly freeing of library (which you seldom need) class can be used
  * explicitly allocated on the stack or something and freed up in DTOR of class!
  * <br>
  * Class is also reference counting instances of the same library and only actually
  * calls LoadLibrary the first time it's instantiated with the same arguments!
  * Though when LAST object with same arguments goes out of scope library is
  * UNLOADED! Note also that library names are case sensitive in the refcounting
  * part, also "path sensitive". Meaning it will differentiate between e.g.
  * "%SYSTEM%/x.dll" and "x.dll" though there probably IS no real difference, this is
  * a potential "hard to track" bug meaning always instantiate this class with the
  * EXACT SAME arguments! <br>
  * See example usage in RichTextBox.h
