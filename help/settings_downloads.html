<h1>Downloads</h1>
<p>This page contains the configuration options for where DC++ will
place complete and incomplete downloads, options that control the
maximum simultaneous downloads, and information on the public hub list
that DC++ will use.</p>
<h2>Directories</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<dl>
  <dt>Default Download Directory</dt>
  <dd>After a download is complete, DC++ tries to move your
just&nbsp;finished file to this directory.&nbsp; It defaults to the
"Downloads\" subdirectory under where the DC++ executable is located.</dd>
  <dt>Unfinished Downloads Directory</dt>
  <dd>All incomplete downloads will be stored in this directory.
If the file has been downloaded with a TTH, the incomplete file will
bear the name &lt;filename&gt;.&lt;ext&gt;.&lt;TTH&gt;.dctmp. If
the file has no TTH, it will be
named&lt;filename&gt;.&lt;ext&gt;.dctmp. If <a
 href="settings_advanced.html#antifrag">Use AntiFragmentation Method
for Downloads</a> is enabled the files will have ".antifrag" added to
the end of it's name. As in
&lt;filename&gt;.&lt;ext&gt;.&lt;TTH&gt;.dctmp.antifrag. </dd>
</dl>
</div>
<h2>Limits</h2>
<p>For both values listed below, certain conditions can result in the
limits not being obeyed.&nbsp;Specifically, up to 3 files that are set
to the 'highest' priority can be transferred while other downloads are
going.&nbsp;&nbsp;File lists and small files (64 kilobytes&nbsp;or
smaller) are queued with 'highest' as their priority.&nbsp; When either
of the limits are hit, DC++ shows "<em>All download slots taken"</em>
next to each source in the Transfer View.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<dl>
  <dt>Maximum Simultaneous Downloads</dt>
  <dd>This limits the number of simultaneous downloads.&nbsp; The
default value&nbsp;of this option is 3, and a value of 0 means no limit.</dd>
  <dt>No New Downloads if Speed Exceeds</dt>
  <dd>This is another method of limiting simultaneous downloads,
designed to prevent new downloads if your existing downloads exceed a
specific threshold.&nbsp;It's measured in kilobytes per second, and a
value of zero will disable this limit.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Note: because of changing download speeds,
this is not 100% accurate</span></dd>
</dl>
</div>
<h2><a name="hublist"></a>Public Hub List</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<dl>
  <dt>Public Hub List&nbsp; URL</dt>
  <dd>The URL specified here will be downloaded when you to to the
Public Hubs window.&nbsp; It must be a valid http address.</dd>
  <dt>HTTP Proxy</dt>
  <dd>This HTTP proxy will <u>only</u> be used to request the Public
Hub List specified above.&nbsp; It's <u>not</u> used for uploads,
downloads, or connecting to a hub.</dd>
