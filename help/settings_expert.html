<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <dt><a name="rollback"></a>Rollback</dt>
  <dd>The number of bytes that will be requested from the remote user
that overlap the existing incomplete file on disk. The
overlapping bytes are compared, and if they do not match, the source is
judged to be incompatible, and is removed with a "Rollback
inconsistency, existing file does not match the one being downloaded"
error. This value normally has no effect when <a href="settings_queue.html#advanced_resume">Advanced Resume</a> is
enabled. (default: 4096)</dd>
  <dt>Max Hash Speed</dt>
  <dd>This is the speed at which DC++ will hash your files, in MiB/s.
It is limited by the speed of your disk subsystem, but it can be
used to make hashing slower and less noticable. A "normal" hash
speed may be anywhere from 20 to 30 MiB/s.  (no default)</dd>
  <dt>PM history</dt>
  <dd>The number of lines that will be read from the private message
log and displayed when a new PM is received. (no default)</dd>
  <dt><a name="minislotsize">Mini slot size</a></dt>
  <dd>This defines the size of the <a href="settings_sharing.html#slots">mini slot</a>. The minimum value for this setting is&nbsp;64 KiB. (default: 64 KiB)</dd>
  <dt>Max filelist size</dt>
  <dd>This setting controls the size of the maximum file list that DC++
will open, in mebibytes. This setting helps protect against
malformed file lists that require large amounts of memory to decode.
&nbsp;You may need to reduce or increase the value of this setting
based on personal experience. (default: 512 MiB)</dd>
  <dt>Write Buffer Size</dt>
  <dd>This controls the size of the chunks that DC++ writes to disk for downloads. Measured in kibibytes. (default: 16 KiB)</dd>
  <dt>Max Tab Rows</dt>
  <dd>The maximum number of rows of tabs that DC++ will make. Any
tabs that do not fit will be accessible through the chevron at the
right of the tab control. (default: 2)</dd>
  <dt><a name="searchhistory">Search history</a></dt>
  <dd>Number of old search lines that will be shown in the Search Window. (default: 10)</dd>
  <dt>Bind address</dt>
  <dd>This setting allows you to bind DC++ to a particular IP address
on your machine. Most users do not need to change the default value,
0.0.0.0. However, if you&nbsp;have more than one network interface
connected to the internet, you can force DC++ to use a particular
connection by entering its IP here. If binding fails, it will do
so silently and INADDR_ANY will be used instead. If you experience
connection problems make sure that this is set to default. (default:
0.0.0.0)<br>
    <span style="font-style: italic;"> This feature requires a restart to be fully effective.</span></dd>
  <dt>CID</dt>
  <dd>This option let you change your client identification scheme. The CID enable clients and users to uniqely identify you.</dd>
  <dt>Socket read buffer</dt>
  <dd>The size of the buffer DC++ use to read sockets. Measured in bytes. (default: 8192 byte)</dd>
  <dt>Socket write buffer</dt>
  <dd>The size of the buffer DC++ use to write to sockets. Measured in bytes. (default: 8192 byte)</dd>
