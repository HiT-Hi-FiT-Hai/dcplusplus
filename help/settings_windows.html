<dt>Open Private Messages in Their Own Window</dt>
  <dd cshelp=IDH_SETTINGS_WINDOWS_POPUP_PMS>If you disable this option, a private message from a user appears
as a status line in main chat instead of in a separate window. This
could cause you to miss some messages if you don't check the chat
regularly. <span style="font-style: italic;">You may not care much for
private messages from other users. Ignoring them however, not only
lessens the (user-friendly) Direct Connect experience, but is not
always wise because failing to reply to a message from an Operator can
get you kicked or, in the worst case, permanently banned from that hub.</span></dd>
  <dt>Open Private Messages from bots in their Own Window</dt>
  <dd cshelp=IDH_SETTINGS_WINDOWS_POPUP_HUB_PMS>Enable this if you want messages from hub bots in their own
