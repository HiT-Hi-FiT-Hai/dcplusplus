<h2>Windows options</h2>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
<dt>Open Private Messages in Their Own Window</dt>
  <dd>If you disable this option, a private message from a user appears
as a status line in main chat instead of in a separate window. This
could cause you to miss some messages if you don't check the chat
regularly. <span style="font-style: italic;">You may not care much for
private messages from other users. Ignoring them however, not only
lessens the (user-friendly) Direct Connect experience, but is not
always wise because failing to reply to a message from an Operator can
get you kicked or, in the worst case, permanently banned from that hub.</span></dd>
  <dt>Open Private Messages from bots in their Own Window</dt>
  <dd>Enable this if you want messages from hub bots in their own
window. When disabled they get sent as a status message in main chat
instead which is less annoying yet still informative. <span style="font-style: italic;">This option only matters if you're not
ignoring private messages from bots.</span></dd>
  <dt>Open Private Messages from the hub in their Own Window</dt>

  <dt>Open New File List Windows in the Background</dt>
  <dd>Keep this disabled if you want newly downloaded file lists to pop
up in front of other windows. <span style="font-style: italic;">It can

something.</span></dd>

the behavior of Windows 98+ and send the currently active window to the
background. The most recently accessed window will become the new
active window.</dd>
  <dt>Popup box to input password for hubs</dt>
  <dd>When being prompted for a password in a hub, you will with this option enabled have a box popup and will allow you to enter your password. With this option disabled, you will be prompted with a "/password" instead.
