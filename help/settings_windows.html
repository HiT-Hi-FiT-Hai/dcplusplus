<h2>Windows options</h2>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
<dt>Open Private Messages in Their Own Window</dt>
  <dd>If you disable this option, a private message from a user appears
as a status line in main chat instead of in a separate window. This
could cause you to miss some messages if you don't check the chat
regularly. <span style="font-style: italic;">You may not care much for
private messages from other users. Ignoring them however, not only
lessens the (user-friendly) Direct Connect experience, but is not
always wise because failing to reply to a message from an Operator can
get you kicked or, in the worst case, permanently banned from that hub.</span></dd>
  <dt>Open Private Messages From Offline Users in Their Own Window</dt>
  <dd>Enable this if you want messages from hub bots in their own
window. When disabled they get sent as a status message in main chat
instead which is less annoying yet still informative. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">This option only matters if you're not
ignoring private messages from offline users (previous option).</span></dd>
  <dt>Open New File List Windows in the Background</dt>
  <dd>Keep this disabled if you want newly downloaded filelists to pop
up in front of other windows. <span style="font-style: italic;">It can
be very annoying to have a new window pop up when you're typing
something.</span></dd>
  <dt>Open New Private Message Windows in the Background</dt>
  <dd>Keep this disabled if you want new private messages filelists to
pop up in front of other windows.</dd>
  <dt><a name="new_window"></a>Open new window when using /join</dt>
  <dd>When using /join &lt;ip&gt;, a new window with the hub will open.</dd>
  <dt>Ignore Private Messages From Offline Users</dt>
  <dd>Enable this if you wish to ignore private messages from users
that are not online on the hub. These messages originate from hub bots
and generally contain useful information, like hub specific rules or
warnings.</dd>
