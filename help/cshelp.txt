.topic IDH_SETTINGS_GENERAL_PERSONAL_INFORMATION
This is general information about yourself. The nick is required, though it's suggested that you pick the correct connection type as well.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_GENERAL_NICK
This nickname, or handle, will identify you when you join a hub. It can be overridden on a per-hub basis in the Favorite Hub Properties.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_GENERAL_EMAIL
This field is for sharing your email address, if you wish it.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_GENERAL_DESCRIPTION
This description will show in the user list. It can be overridden on a per-hub basis in the Favorite Hub Properties.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_GENERAL_CONNECTION
This drop-down contains a number of common upload speeds (in MiB/s), please choose the one closest to your own. Do not put in your download speed; this setting is a measure of how fast a source you are likely to be for other users.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_DIRECT
Select this mode if your computer is hooked directly to the internet. Do not select this mode if you have a router (firewall) or a software firewall.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_FIREWALL_UPNP
Select this mode if you are behind a firewall that supports the UPnP standard for program auto-configuration. DC++ will automatically open the ports it needs and obtain your external IP address. This mode is not available on operating systems before Windows XP, as it was the first version to have UPnP support.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_FIREWALL_NAT
Select this mode if you are behind a firewall (router), and will set up the TCP and UDP port forwarding on your own. You will need to specify the external IP address of your router using the setting below if you want downloads to work properly.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_FIREWALL_PASSIVE
Select this mode if none of the previous options apply. In this mode, DC++ will not try to make inbound connections, only outbound ones. This mode carries some limitations: - only 5 results per user will be returned in response to searches; - you will not be able to download from other passive users.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_PORT_TCP
This is the port that DC++ listens on for incoming client connections. If this setting is blank, DC++ will use a random port between 1025 and 32000.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_PORT_UDP
This is the port that DC++ listens on for incoming search results. If this setting is blank, DC++ will use a random port between 1025 and 32000.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_PORT_TLS
This is the port that DC++ listens on for TLS connections. If this setting is blank, DC++ will use a random port between 1025 and 32000.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_EXTERNAL_IP
If you're directly connected to the internet, DC++ will tell remote users to connect to your local IP. Fill in this box only if you need to override the auto-detection. Ordinarily, only users behind a home router (NAT device) will need to fill in this box. If you put a DNS name here, DC++ will try to resolve it into an IP address before use.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_OVERRIDE
Enable this to always use the IP address in "External / WAN IP", and not let either UPnP or connected hubs change it.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_DIRECT_OUT
Select this mode if you can make unrestricted outbound connections. This includes connecting to any IP address on any port.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_SOCKS5
Select this mode if you want to make outbound connections through a SOCKS proxy. The caveats for Firewall (passive) mode also apply here. SOCKS5 proxies are not the same as HTTP proxies. DC++'s SOCKS5 support does not include GSSAPI.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_SOCKS_SERVER
This is the IP, not host name, of your SOCKS5 server.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_SOCKS_PORT
The port that your SOCKS5 server runs on. The default is 1080.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_SOCKS_USER
Login name for the SOCKS5 proxy; may be required.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_SOCKS_PASSWORD
Password for the SOCKS5 proxy; may be required.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_SOCKS_RESOLVE
Enable this to use the SOCKS5 proxy, instead of the local name server, to resolve host names into IP addresses.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_DOWNLOAD_DOWNLOADDIR
After a download is complete, DC++ tries to move your just finished file to this directory. It defaults to the "Downloads\" subdirectory under where the DC++ executable is located.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_DOWNLOAD_TEMP_DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY
All incomplete downloads will be stored in this directory. If empty, temporary downloads will be stored in the "Incomplete\" subdirectory under where the DC++ executable is located. You can use %[targetdrive] for optional unfinished directory for target drive. If the file has been downloaded with a TTH, the incomplete file will bear the name <filename>.<ext>.<TTH>.dctmp. If the file has no TTH, it will be named<filename>.<ext>.dctmp. If "Use AntiFragmentation Method for Downloads" is enabled the files will have ".antifrag" added to the end of it's name. As in <filename>.<ext>.<TTH>.dctmp.antifrag.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_DOWNLOAD_LIMITS
For both values listed below, certain conditions can result in the limits not being obeyed. Specifically, up to 3 files that are set to the 'highest' priority can be transferred while other downloads are going.  File lists and small files (64 kibibytes or smaller) are queued with 'highest' as their priority. When either of the limits are hit, DC++ shows "All download slots taken" next to each source in the Transfer View.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_DOWNLOAD_DOWNLOADS
This limits the number of simultaneous downloads. The default value of this option is 3, and a value of 0 means no limit.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_DOWNLOAD_MAXSPEED
This is another method of limiting simultaneous downloads, designed to prevent new downloads if your existing downloads exceed a specific threshold. It's measured in kibibytes per second, and a value of zero will disable this limit.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_DOWNLOAD_PROXY
This HTTP proxy will only be used to request the Public Hub List specified above. It's not used for uploads, downloads, or connecting to a hub.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_FAVORITE_DIRS_FAVORITE_DIRECTORIES
To add directories to your "Download to" menu (right click on a file in the search frame), you can use the Add and Remove buttons, or drag and drop folders from a Windows Explorer window.

.topic IDH_SETTINGS_FAVORITE_DIRS_REMOVE
Remove the selected folder(s).
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_FAVORITE_DIRS_ADD
Browse for a new folder to add to your share. After selecting the directory to add, you will be able to pick the Virtual Name name for it that will be shown in the menu.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_AUTOPRIO
Autoprio allows setting the queue item priority automatically when adding it to the download queue. A user can then change the priority of a file manually. Priority conditions are checked from the Highest to the Lowest priority, when assigning a priority to a new queue item. A zero means that the given priority level won't be used - except Normal priority, which is the default priority. Lowest possible value for the Highest priority is 16 KiB.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_PRIO_HIGHEST
Files with the same or under the entered size will be set to Highest as priority. (default: 64 KiB)
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_PRIO_NORMAL
Files with the same or under the entered size, but above Highest and High prio max size, will be set to Normal as priority. (default: 0 KiB)
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_PRIO_HIGH
Files with the same or under the entered size, but above Highest prio max size, will be set to High as priority. (default: 0 KiB)
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_PRIO_LOW

.topic IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_AUTODROP
Autodrop allows automatical removal (or disconnecting) of slow download sources. By default, slow sources are removed. All of these autodrop options are necessary to estimate and disconnect/drop sources properly.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_AUTODROP_SPEED
If the download speed of a file is below the entered value, the source will be dropped. (default: 1024 B/s)
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_AUTODROP_ELAPSED
Amount of time (in seconds) that has to pass since the download started before a source can be dropped. (default: 15 s)
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_AUTODROP_MINSOURCES
Minimum amount of sources before any sources will be dropped. (default: 1)
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_AUTODROP_INTERVAL
Check every x second(s) if the source is slow. (default: 10 s)
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_AUTODROP_INACTIVITY
This is the maximal time since the last chunk of data for the file was recieved. It is meant to improve speed measurement accuracy and to prevent dropping sources that are going to be disconnected only because of their current inactivity. (default: 10 s)
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_AUTODROP_FILESIZE
Minimum filesize before sources will be dropped (in KiB). (default: 0 KiB)
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_UPLOAD_DIRECTORIES
To add directories to your share, you can use the Add and Remove buttons, or drag and drop folders from a Windows Explorer window. Beginning with version 0.4032, files will be shared only once they have been hashed. If you enter the Sharing tab and press OK; the client may appear to freeze, this is due to a refresh of the file list.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_UPLOAD_SHAREHIDDEN
Share files with the Hidden attribute set and files inside directory with the Hidden attribute set. With this option off, files starting with a . (full stop) will not be shared. Note: this option requires a refresh of the file list, and may cause the client to appear to freeze.

Change the virtual name on a shared folder. Note: the client will appear to freeze when you exit settings, this is due to a refresh of the file list.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_UPLOAD_REMOVE
Remove the selected folder(s).
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_UPLOAD_ADD
Browse for a new folder to add to your share. If another existing file shares that name, the new name will be made unique by adding another letter to its name. After selecting the directory to add, you will be able to pick the Virtual Name that it will be shown under when other users see your files. If the newly added files have not been hashed, the Hash Progress Dialog will display. You can choose to let it display, or let hashing continue in the background.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_UPLOAD_MIN_UPLOAD_SPEED
If the average upload speed drops below the given number, an additional upload slot will be granted. These slots are granted once every 30 seconds at maximum. If the speed of the original uploads increases, the granted slot will not be closed.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_UPLOAD_SLOTS
Configure the number of slots that other users can occupy to download files from you. A remote user can use only one slot for each hub that they're on with you. DC++ supports uploading file lists and files below 64 KiB to other DC++ users without requiring a slot. There's a max of 3 connections in addition to normal slots, these are called mini slots. Note: If a user leaves the hub, DC++ will close his slots; if the user is back within 10 minutes, DC++ will grant him a slot. (This will only happen if "Automatically Disconnect Users Who Leave the Hub" is enabled.) This can cause your upload slots going over maximum set in settings.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_APPEARANCE_DEFAULT_AWAY_MESSAGE
This is the default away message that will appear when someone PMs you for the first time while you are in the away mode. You can activate away mode by using the /away <message> and /back chat commands or "Auto-away on Minimize" option. All time formatting variables are available. Use Ctrl + Enter to create a new line.

.topic IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED3_ROLLBACK
This option is not used currently.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED3_MAX_HASH_SPEED
This is the speed at which DC++ will hash your files, in MiB/s. It is limited by the speed of your disk subsystem, but it can be used to make hashing slower and less noticable. A "normal" hash speed may be anywhere from 20 to 30 MiB/s. (no default)

The number of lines that will be read from the private message log and displayed when a new PM is received. (no default)
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED3_MINISLOT_SIZE
This defines the size of the mini slot. The minimum value for this setting is 64 KiB. (default: 64 KiB)
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED3_MAX_FILELIST_SIZE
This setting controls the size of the maximum file list that DC++ will open, in mebibytes. This setting helps protect against malformed file lists that require large amounts of memory to decode.  You may need to reduce or increase the value of this setting based on personal experience. (default: 512 MiB)
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED3_PRIVATE_ID

.topic IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED3_SEARCH_HISTORY
Number of old search lines that will be shown in the Search Window. (default: 10)
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED3_BIND_ADDRESS
This setting allows you to bind DC++ to a particular IP address on your machine. Most users do not need to change the default value, 0.0.0.0. However, if you have more than one network interface connected to the internet, you can force DC++ to use a particular connection by entering its IP here. If binding fails, it will do so silently and INADDR_ANY will be used instead. If you experience connection problems make sure that this is set to default. (default: 0.0.0.0) This feature requires a restart to be fully effective.
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED3_SOCKET_IN_BUFFER
The size of the buffer DC++ use to read sockets. Measured in bytes. (default: 8192 bytes)
.topic IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED3_SOCKET_OUT_BUFFER
