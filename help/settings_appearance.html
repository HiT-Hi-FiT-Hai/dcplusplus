<h1>Appearance</h1>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Note: Most of these options require
that you restart DC++. (Fonts, colors and icons are loaded at startup
only. Window settings are loaded when opening a new window.)</span>
<h2>Options</h2>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <dt>Sort all downloads first</a>
  <dd>With this option enabled, DC++ will sort the downloads and uploads; Current download(s), waiting download(s), current upload(s) and waiting upload(s). <br>With this option disabled, DC++ will sort downloads and uploads; Current download(s), current uploads(s), waiting download(s) and waiting upload(s)</dd>
  <dt>Filter kick and NMDC Debug Messages</dt>
  <dd>When enabled, kick and debug chat messages (sent by other
clients) are hidden from main chat. These messages are generally not
useful and make reading the chat more troublesome.</dd>
  <dt>Minimize to Tray</dt>
  <dd>When enabled, minimizing DC++ will cause it to appear as an icon
in the windows system tray. If you left click, it will be
returned to its previous status. If you right click on the icon,
it will give you a small menu.</dd>
  <dt>Show Timestamps in Chat By Default</dt>
  <dd>This option will show time stamps on chat lined in newly opened
hubs. In order to show them in an already open hub, use the <a
 href="chat_commands.html#ts">/ts chat command</a>. To customize the
format of the time stamps, see the <a href="#set_timestamps">Set
Timestamps</a> option below.</dd>
  <dt>View Status Messages in Main Chat</dt>
  <dd>Show some messages destined for the Status Bar in main chat as
well. <span style="font-style: italic;">It's generally a good idea to
leave this enabled.</span></dd>
  <dt>Show Joins / Parts in Chat By Default</dt>
  <dd>Show an entry in main chat whenever someone joins or leaves the
hub. Use the <a href="chat_commands.html#showjoins">/showjoins chat
command</a>
to enable or disable it on already open hubs. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">On large hubs, you don't want this enabled.</span></dd>
  <dt>Only Show Joins / Parts for Favorite Users</dt>
  <dd>With this option enabled, only the joining and parting of
<a href="window_favorite_users.html">Favorite Users</a> are shown.</dd>
  <dt>Sort favorite users first</dt>
  <dd>With this option enabled, those users who are <a href=window_favorite_users.html>favorite users</a> will be sorted first in user lists.</dd>
  <dt>Use System Icons When Browsing Files</dt>
  <dd>If you have this option on, DC++ will use the per-extension icons
from Windows Explorer. <span style="font-style: italic;">Turning
on this option slows browsing file lists a bit.</span></dd>
  <dt>Use OEM Monospaced Font for Viewing Text Files</dt>
  <dd>Enable this option to use a monospaced font more suitable for
viewing NFO files in the built-in text viewer (the "View as Text"
function).</dd>
  <dt>Guess User Country</dt>
  <dd>When selected, country codes for your uploaders and downloaders
appear in the Transfer View. The <a href="links.html#geoip">GeoIPCountryWhois.csv</a> database is the one provided by <a href="http://www.maxmind.com" target="_blank" class="external">MaxMind</a> <img title="External Link" src="external.png" border="0" height="10" width="10">.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">

PMs you for the first time while you are in the away mode. You
can activate away mode by using the <a

  <dt><a name="set_timestamps"></a>Set Timestamps</dt>
  <dd>This lets you select the format of the time stamps that can
appear in the chat and private message windows. For the available
formatting variables, please see <a
