<h1>Security Certificates</h1>

  <dt>Private key file</dt>
  <dd cshelp=IDH_SETTINGS_CERTIFICATES_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE>This file is your personal and private certificate file. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Do not share this with other users or hubs.</span> If you do, you risk allowing others to use your certificate and in essence pose as you.</dd>

  <dd cshelp=IDH_SETTINGS_CERTIFICATES_CERTIFICATE_FILE>This file is the certificate file you should give to other users and hubs that you want to consider "trusted". </dd>

<h2>Options</h2>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <dt>Use SSL when remote client supports it</dt>
  <dd>When this option is enabled, DC++ will connect to&nbsp;remote
clients on an ADC hub that support SSL using SSL. &nbsp;This option is
an experimental one, and shouldn't imply that DC++ is secure in any way.</dd>
  <dt>Allow TLS connections to hubs without trusted certificate</dt>
  <dd>With this option disabled, all hubs you connect to must have a certificate in your Trusted certificate folder.</dd>
  <dt>Allow TLS connections to clients without trusted certificate</dt>
  <dd>With this option disabled, all client you connect to must have a certificate in your Trusted certificate folder.</dd>
</dl>
To see effects, please restart DC++.<br>

SSL support is an experimental feature and doesn't imply that DC++ is secure in any way.
