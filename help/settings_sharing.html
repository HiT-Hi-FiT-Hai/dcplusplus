<h1>Sharing</h1>
<h2>Shared Directories</h2>
To add&nbsp;directories to your share, you can use the Add and Remove
buttons, or drag and drop folders from a Windows Explorer window.&nbsp;
<em style="font-weight: bold;">Beginning with version 0.4032, files
will be shared only once they have been hashed.</em><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> &nbsp;</span>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <dt>Add Folder</dt>
  <dd>Browse for a new folder to add to your share.&nbsp; If another
existing file shares that name, the new name will be made unique by
adding another letter to its name.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>After
selecting the directory
to add, you will be able to pick the Virtual Name that it will be shown
under when other users see your files. If the newly added files have
not been hashed, the Hash Progress Dialog will display.&nbsp; You can
choose to let it display, or let hashing continue in the background.<br>
  </dd>
  <dt>Remove</dt>
  <dd>Remove the selected folder(s).<br>
  </dd>
  <dt>Share Hidden Files</dt>
  <dd>Share files with the Hidden attribute set and files inside
directory with the Hidden attribute set. With this option off, files starting with a . (full stop) will not be shared. Files that have a $ in the filename will not be shared due to a protocol limitation. Note: this option requires a
refresh of the file list, and may cause the client to appear to freeze.<br>
  </dd>
  <dt>Rename</dt>
  <dd>Change the virtual name on a shared folder. Note: the client will
  appear to freeze when you exit settings, this is due to a refresh of the filelist.</dd>
</dl>

  <dt>Automatically Open an Extra Slot if Speed is Below ...</dt>
  <dd>If the average upload speed drops below the given number, an
additional upload slot will be granted.&nbsp; These slots are granted
once every 30 seconds at maximum.&nbsp; If the speed of the original
uploads increases, the granted slot will not be closed.</dd>
  <dt>Upload Slots</dt>
  <dd>Configure the number of slots that other users can occupy to
download files from you.&nbsp; A remote user can use only one slot for
each hub that they're on with you.<br>
