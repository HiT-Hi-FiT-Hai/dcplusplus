<h1>Indexing progress</h1>
This window will display what file is currently being indexed (hashed) by DC++, at what rate and approximately how long time there is left.
<br/>
<br/>
With this window open, DC++ will index at the priority level of "normal". If DC++ index in the background, the priority level is "lowest" (below "normal"). The priority level affect how much access time DC++ should get for indexing files. A higher priority mean that DC++ will index more frequent, but will also put on more strain on the computer and it will possibly perform slower.
<br/>
<br/>
Note that files will not be shared until they are indexed.
