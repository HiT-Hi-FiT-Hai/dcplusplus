<h1>Setting up active mode</h1>
<p>For DC++ to work properly in active mode, it requires access on <acronym
 title="Transmission Control Protocol">TCP</acronym> and <acronym
 title="User Datagram Protocol">UDP</acronym> listening ports, as well
as outgoing access on all ports for both TCP and UDP.</p>
<p>You can simplify the process of setting up active mode if your
router and operating system is <acronym title="Universal Plug and Play">UPnP
</acronym> compatible. If so, please read the <a href="faq_upnp.html">How to set up UPnP FAQ</a> instead, for more information.</p>
<ol>
  <li>First you need to set up the router to forward the connections to
the computer with DC++. This is could be called Port mapping, port
redirecting, port forwarding or something like that. Find out how to do
this with your router / <acronym title="Network Address Translation">NAT</acronym>
in the user manual.</li>
  <li>You need to forward two ports, with either the same port number
or different ones. Select one or two numbers between 1024 -
65535, they should mostly all be free. Make sure both UDP and TCP is
being forwarded on the port(s) you chose. </li>
  <li>The IP that you are forwarding to should be the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">internal</span> IP address of your DC++
computer. It usually begins with <a href="non-routable.html">"192.168",
"172.16." or "10.x."</a>. Go to the command prompt and type: <span
 style="font-style: italic;">ipconfig</span> (Start Menu -&gt; Run
-&gt; <span style="font-style: italic;">cmd /k ipconfig</span>)</li>
  <li>When you have mapped the port(s) on the router, open up DC++ and
go to Settings. Select active mode. In the port fields, enter the port
number(s) that you forwarded on the router. </li>
  <li>In the IP field, you need to enter the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">external</span> IP address of your router.
Your external IP can be checked against <a

IP page</a> <img title="External Link" src="external.png" border="0"
 height="10" width="10" alt="External Link">. </li>
  <li>It should now be working. If it is working for a while, but the
next time you use DC++, you only get "Connection Timeout&#8217;s or no
results when searching, your IP (either <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">external</span> or <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">internal</span>) is likely to have changed.
If you find the external IP is constantly changing, you can set
yourself up with a dynamic name (i.e. <i>hub.example.com</i>).
Such as <a href="http://www.dynip.com/" target="_blank"
 class="external">Dynip</a> <img title="External Link"
 src="external.png" border="0" height="10" width="10" alt="External Link"> or <a
 href="http://www.dyndns.org/" target="_blank" class="external">DynDns</a>
    <img title="External Link" src="external.png" border="0" height="10"
 width="10" alt="External Link"> and put that name into the IP field. Make sure to use a
program that updates the dynamic name service with your latest IP.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Windows XP?</h2>
<ul>
  <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Service Pack 1</span>:
Its strongly recommended that you do not use the SP1 firewall and
instead use a third party one.
Make sure to disable the XP firewall if you do choose this option. If
you really must use it, then checkout <a
 href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/protect/ports.asp"
 target="_blank" class="external"> this guide</a> <img
 title="External Link" src="external.png" border="0" height="10"
 width="10" alt="External Link"> on how to set it up.</li>
  <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Service Pack 2</span>:
The firewall in SP2 is a lot more robust than its original incarnation.
While it does not offer a plethora of options, its suitable to use by
itself for protection. Its wise to enable logging of packets that the
firewall drops for troubleshooting applications. To do this, go to
Control Panels -&gt; Windows Firewall -&gt; Advanced Tab -&gt; Security
Logging -&gt; Settings. Enable <span style="font-style: italic;">Log
Dropped Packets</span>. The log file is located at:
C:\WINDOWS\pfirewall.log.</li>
