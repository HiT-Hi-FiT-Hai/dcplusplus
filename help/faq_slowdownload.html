<h1>Slow download speeds </h1>
<p>If you experience slow downloads, it could be for many reasons:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The upload bandwidth of the person you're downloading from is
maxed out. Don't pay attention to the value of the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">connection type</span> column, the value
is often is not an accurate representation of the user's
connection type.
    <ul>
      <li>Users with fewer slots used <span style="font-style: italic;">may</span>
result in faster speeds - someone with two out of three (2/3) slots
free may have more bandwidth available than someone with one out of
three (1/3). This number appears in the status column of the
Search Window. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You need to optimize your operating system for your current
connection speed. First, <span style="font-weight: bold;">close <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span></span> <acronym
 title="peer to peer">P2P</acronym> applications. Next run the <a
 href="http://www.dslreports.com/tweaks" target="_blank" class="external">DSLReports
TweakTest</a> <img title="External Link" src="external.png" border="0"
 height="10" width="10" alt="External Link"/>. Once you have optimized it, then run a 
<a href="http://www.dslreports.com/stest" target="_blank" class="external">Speed
Test</a> <img title="External Link" src="external.png" border="0"
 height="10" width="10" alt="External Link"/> (select the site closest to your location for
accurate results). This will give you a good idea what your
maximum download and upload speeds are. If you're getting within
10% of your connection speed, that's the best you can get! If you
are having trouble with your <span style="font-style: italic;">broadband</span>
connection, and it relates to packet loss, excessive latency, or
Internet or <acronym title="Internet Service Provider">ISP</acronym>
congestion, running the <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/linequality"
 target="_blank" class="external">Line Quality Test </a><img
 title="External Link" src="external.png" border="0" height="10"
 width="10" alt="External Link"/> may help find the cause (<i>requires logon, free signup).</i>
  </li>
  <li>The person who you are downloading from is using a bandwidth
limiter. There are two types: client based and third-party
program. <br/>
    <ul>
      <li>Often the clients with limiting capability have set download
and upload speed ratios in place to avoid abuse. (ex. If the
upload speed limit is set below 6 KiB/s, then the client will restrict
the client download speed to a 2:1 ratio). This varies from
client to client and obviously not all support upload limiting.&nbsp;
This type of speed limiting <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span>
restricts the uploading of files, including user lists. It
does not limit chat, private messages, or searches.</li>
      <li>Users could also be using a third-party program to limit the
speed of traffic. This type of speed limiting is absolute; it
will limit the speed of all traffic by the user, which can include file
transfers, searches, chat, and private messages. Since this type
of application does not enforce a download speed:upload speed ratio, it
may be more prone to abuse. For particularly slow transfers - 1
KiB/s or slower, it <span style="font-weight: bold;">may</span> be to
blame. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Your Internet connection is shared with others on your <acronym
 title="Local Area Network">LAN</acronym> and they are using up all the
available bandwidth. Tell them to knock it off. =) </li>
  <li>Your copy of Windows XP or Server 2003 has the "<acronym
 title="Quality of Service">QoS</acronym> Packet Scheduler"
enabled. Follow <a
 href="http://support.earthlink.net/mu/1/psc/img/walkthroughs/windows_XP/6800.psc.html"
 target="_blank" class="external"> this guide to disable QoS</a> <img
 title="External Link" src="external.png" border="0" height="10"
 width="10" alt="External Link"/>. Windows 95/98, Millennium, and 2000 do not come
with QoS. Some routers have QoS capabilities, but shouldn't be
enabled by default. Please consult your router's manual for more
information. </li>
  <li>Your ISP may be limiting your P2P traffic via some method of
packet shaping. Call up the ISP and inquire if they do anything
with P2P traffic. If the ISP <span style="font-style: italic;">does</span>
throttle you, then there is nothing that can be done to increase the
speeds. This is very common at Universities and at the workplace,
and is <a href="faq_university.html">the topic of another FAQ</a>.</li>
  <li>Your Internet connection is <acronym
 title="Digital Subscriber Loop">DSL</acronym>, cable, or satellite one
with an asymmetrical connection speed, such as 768/128 Kib/s or
3.0 Mib/s / 256 Kib/s. On such connections, if you upload near the speed of
your upload limit (16 KiB/s in the case of the 768/128 connection), it
will affect the speeds of your downloads, no matter how much larger
your download connection is. If this is happening, you can use
the "<a href="settings_advanced.html#smallbuffer">Use small send buffer</a>"
setting. </li>
