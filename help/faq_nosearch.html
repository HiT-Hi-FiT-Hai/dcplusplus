<h1> Why don't I get any search results? </h1>
<p>Assuming that you can connect to a hub and chat with users, this is
usually caused by a firewall, router, or connection sharing. There are
several things you can try:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Enter your external <acronym title="Internet Protocol">IP</acronym>
address
in the settings dialog and try again. Find out the IP from <a
 href="http://www.dslreports.com/ip" target="_blank" class="external">DSLReport's
IP page</a> <img title="External Link" src="external.png" border="0"
 height="10" width="10">.</li>
  <li>Check your firewall's configuration. You need to make sure it's
allowing or forwarding incoming connections on the port specified in
the settings. You have to enable both <acronym
 title="Transmission Control Protocol">TCP</acronym> and <acronym
 title="User Datagram Protocol">UDP</acronym> traffic. If you can
download, but not search, UDP is blocked. Please read the FAQ on <a
 href="faq_activemode.html">How to set up active mode</a>.</li>
  <li>Your school or work might be blocking DC traffic. Read the FAQ on
types of blocks, and what you <a href="faq_university.html">might be
able to do about it</a>.</li>
  <li>If the above things don't work for you, you'll have to use
passive mode (if the hub allows it).</li>
</ol>
