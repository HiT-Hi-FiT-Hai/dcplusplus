<h1>My University blocks DC++</h1>
<h2>Blocking and Throttling</h2>
<p>Many Universities have policies that limit the usage of peer to peer
applications by students and employees. Typically, these policies block
or limit the amount of bandwidth that <acronym title="peer to peer">p2p</acronym>
applications can use, and are enforced by employing solutions from <a
 target="_blank" href="http://www.packeteer.com/" class="external">Packeteer</a>
<img title="External Link" src="external.png" border="0" height="10"
 width="10" alt="External Link"/>, <a class="external" target="_blank"
 href="http://www.netlogicmicro.com/">NetLogic
Microsystems</a> <img title="External Link" src="external.png"
 border="0" height="10" width="10" alt="External Link"/>, or a similar company. This
software/hardware solution has the ability to look into a <acronym
 title="Transmission Control Protocol">TCP</acronym> packet, determine
what class of application created it, then throttle or block it
accordingly.</p>
<p>If you're behind such a block, please learn to live with it.
Circumventing the block by proxying is detectable, is probably against
your <acronym title="Acceptable Use Policy">AUP</acronym>, is
technically difficult, and impossible to do without help from someone
outside the firewall.</p>
<h2>Network Address Translation</h2>
<p>Other schools might have their network behind a <acronym
 title="Network Address Translation">NAT</acronym> in which case an
active connection is impossible. If you're inside a NAT, the IP
reported by your computer will be in one of the <a
 href="non-routable.html">non-routable IP ranges</a>. In this case, try
passive mode.</p>
<p>If you cannot connect to DC hubs or cannot transfer files in passive
mode, the above advice about proxying applies.</p>
<h2>Port Blocking</h2>
<p>A few schools use simple port blocking, where common ports used by
DC++ and other p2p
applications are blocked. DC++ uses a wide range of ports for outgoing
traffic and incoming traffic by default. If the school blocks port 411
outgoing connections, then that effectively cuts you off from all DC
hubs since that is the default hub port. Hub lists contain the full
address of many hubs and those that run on non-standard ports (<i>i.e.
hub.example.com:1411</i>) may work.</p>
<p>If you appear to be completely blocked from the DC network, the
above advice applies.</p>
