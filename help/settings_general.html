<h1>General</h1>
<p>This page has general settings for DC++. It contains the identifying
information you choose to share when you join a hub, and also contains
the firewall and connection information to control the mode that DC++
operates in.</p>
<h2>Personal Information</h2>
This is general information about yourself. The nick is required,
though it's suggested that you pick the correct connection type as well.<br>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <dt>Nick</dt>
  <dd>This nickname, or handle, will identify you when you join a hub.
It can be overridden on a per-hub basis in the Favorite Hub Properties.
It is also required.</dd>
  <dt>E-Mail</dt>
  <dd>This field is for sharing your email address, if you wish it.</dd>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>This description will show in the user list. It can be overridden
on a per-hub basis in the Favorite Hub Properties.</dd>
  <dt>Connection Type</dt>
  <dd>This drop-down contains a number of connection types, please
choose the one closest to your own.<br>

<h2><a name="#connection"></a>Connection Settings</h2>
There are three modes of connection in DC++: Active, Passive, or
SOCKS5. If you have problems configuring them, or problems connecting
please refer to the FAQ.<br>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <dt style="text-decoration: underline;">Active</dt>
  <dd> In active mode, DC++ needs to make outbound TCP connections and
send UDP packets to other machines, as well as receive inbound TCP
connections and inbound UDP packets. TCP is used for file transfers and
UDP is used for file search results. Remote DC++ clients will return a
maximum of 10 search hits to an active user. A user in active mode will
have M:A in their <a href="plusplus_tag.html">DC++ tag</a>.
    <dl>
      <dt>IP</dt>
      <dd>DC++ will automatically detect and use your local IP. If you
are behind a router (or your IP is otherwise <a
 href="non-routable.html">non-routable</a>) you will need to put in
your external IP here. If you put a DNS name here, DC++ will try to
resolve it into an IP address before use.</dd>
      <dt>Port</dt>
      <dd>This is the port that DC++ listens on: TCP for incoming
client connections and UDP for incoming search results. If this setting
is blank, DC++ will use a random port between 1025 and 32000.</dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
  <dt style="text-decoration: underline;">Passive</dt>
  <dd>In passive mode, DC++ will only make outbound connections to
other users. All searches will be sent through the hub, and search
results will be returned through the hub as well.&nbsp;Remote DC++
clients will return a maximum of 5 search hits for a passive user.
Passive users cannot download from other passive users. Passive mode is
an extra strain on hubs, so please do not use it unless you must. DC++
users in passive mode will have M:P in their <a
 href="plusplus_tag.html">DC++ tag</a>.</dd>
  <dt style="text-decoration: underline;">SOCKS5</dt>
  <dd> In SOCKS mode, DC++ will make a connection to hub through an
existing SOCKS5 proxy server. Connections to users will also be made
through this proxy server. The caveats for passive mode also apply
here. SOCKS5 proxies are not the same as HTTP proxies. DC++'s SOCKS5
support does <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span>
include GSSAPI.<br>
    <dl>
      <dt>Socks IP</dt>
      <dd>This is the IP, not hostname, of your SOCKS5 server.</dd>
      <dt>Port</dt>
      <dd>The port that your SOCKS5 server runs on. The default value
is 1080.</dd>
      <dt>Username</dt>
      <dd>Username for the SOCKS5 proxy; may be required.<br>
      </dd>
      <dt>Password</dt>
      <dd>Password for the SOCKS5 proxy; may be required.<br>
      </dd>
      <dt>Use SOCKS5 server to resolve hostnames</dt>
      <dd>When checked (the default), DC++ will use the SOCKS5 proxy to
resolve hostnames into IP addresses.<br>
      </dd>
