  <dd>1. Download and install <a
 href="http://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/diffutils.html%20target="
 _blank="" class="external">GNU Diff</a> <img title="External Link"
 src="external.png" border="0" height="10" width="10">.</dd>
  <dd>2. Type <i>cmd</i> in Run and navigate your way to where GNU
Diff is installed.</dd>
  <dd>3. Write <i>diff -[parameter(s)] &lt;path to the untouched file
or folder&gt; &lt;path to the changed file or folder&gt; &gt;
my-diff.diff</i></dd>
  <dd>4. A file, my-diff.diff, will now be created in the directory
which GNU Diff is placed. Other extensions for the patch (such as .txt)
are acceptable, there is no standard.</dd>
  <dd><br>
Example: <i>C:\Program Files\GNU Diff&gt;diff -uNr dcplusplus_orig
dcplusplus_chan &gt; my-diff.diff</i> <br>
C:\Program Files\GNU Diff is where GNU Diff is installed.<br>
The parameter <i style="font-weight: bold;">u</i> means the diff will
be unified. <i style="font-weight: bold;">N</i> means that GNU Diff
will show output even if a file doesn't exist in one of the two
folders.
    <i style="font-weight: bold;">r</i> means that GNU Diff will go
through subdirectories and give output on which directory and file
differ.
    <br>
    <i>dcplusplus_orig</i> is the folder that is untouched and what the
changes is going to differ against.
    <br>
    <i>dcplusplus_chan</i> is the folder where changes has occured.
    <br>
The actual diff is <i>my-diff.diff</i>.
    <p>Parameters and more information on how to use GNU Diff can be
found in the documentation for GNU Diff which should have come included
with GNU Diff. Otherwise, the manual can be found at the <a
