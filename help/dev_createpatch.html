  <dd>1. Download and install <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/diffutils.html target="_blank" class="external">GNU Diff</a> <img title="External Link" src="external.png" border="0" height="10" width="10">.</dd>
  <dd>2. Type <i>cmd</i> in Run and tab your way to where GNU Diff is installed.</dd>
  <dd>3. Write <i>diff -[parameter(s)] &lt;path to the untouched file or folder&gt; &lt;path to the changed file or folder&gt; &gt; my-diff.diff</i></dd>
  <dd>4. A file, my-diff.diff will now be created in the directory which GNU Diff is placed. Other formats of files (such as .txt) can of course be created.</dd>
  <dd><br>Example: <i>C:\Program Files\GNU Diff&gt;diff -uNr dcplusplus_orig dcplusplus_chan &gt; my-diff.diff</i>
  <br>C:\Program Files\GNU Diff is where GNU Diff is installed.<br>The parameter <i>u</i> means the diff will be unified. 
<i>N</i> means that GNU Diff will show output even if a file doesn't exist in one of the two folders.
<i>r</i> means that GNU Diff will go through subdirectories and give output on which directory and file differ.
<br><i>dcplusplus_orig</i> is the folder that is untouched and what the changes is going to differ against.
<br><i>dcplusplus_chan</i> is the folder where changes has occured.
<br>The actual diff is <i>my-diff.diff</i>.
<p>Parameters and more information how-to use GNU Diff can be found in the documentation for GNU Diff which should have been accommodated with GNU Diff. Otherwise, click <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/manual/diff.html" target="_blank"
