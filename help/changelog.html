<ul>
  <li>Added a small menu to the tray icon (thanks orkblutt)</li>
  <li>Added port to hub log files</li>

  <li>Speedups, code cleanup to GUI list handling</li>
  <li>New STLPort again (4.6) (a lot of the match queue crashes are probably STLPort's fault, so I'm changing again, to see if the latest is better, + that I changed two lines in it)</li>
  <li>Fixed some bugs in the &amp;-translation</li>
  <li>Can be compiled in MSVC 7.1 without stlport, make sure to undefine HAS_STLPORT in config.h</li>
  <li>Updated the antifrag feature to recover from crashes (thanks distiller)</li>
  <li>Fixed so that tab completion works with multiple [xxx] tags (thanks sed)</li>
  <li>More code cleanup, keep a backup of your queue handy while upgrading, queue code extensively rewritten to ease future changes</li>
  <li>Updates to the autosearch feature</li>
  <li>Added (well, enabled) GetZBlock, a feature that makes all transfers safer by checking CRC's during the transfer and if possible, compresses. This is an experimental feature, and it might require some extra cpu, so it can be turned off in settings, turning it off will turn it off for both up- and downloads. If both users have it enabled it will automatically be used. Compression is automatically turned off file files that don't compress well (.rar's for example), but the extra CRC check is still done. Safe transfers are marked by a * in the active transfers list (I'll think of something better later on...)</li>
  <li>New, very nice progress bars for the transfers window (thanks citruz)</li>
  <li>Multi-shade progress bars to show how much was resumed and compressed</li>

  <li>Other fixes to usercommands (thanks sedulus)</li>

  <li>Added new search for alternates algorithm with possibility to set search string yourself (thanks saurod)</li>

  <li>Added finished bold disable option (thanks garg)</li>
  <li>Minor adjustments to the sort order</li>
  <li>Added anti-fragmentation feature. When downloading, it creates a file of the expected target size with unspecified content. If the download fails, the file is truncated to the size DC++ thinks it has downloaded, and resume should work fine. If DC++ crashes, you'll lose the whole downloaded part + any resumed part as well, as there's no way to know how much valid data there is in the file. Disabled by default.</li>
  <li>Added a few keyboard shortcuts here and there</li>
  <li>Fixed bug with SFV retrying (files will now properly be retried _once_ beforer a source is discarded)</li>
  <li>The maximization state of the inner windows is now remebered, default to maximized first time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>0.24 <span style="color: gray;">(2003-03-11)</span></h2>
<ul>
  <li>The splash screen is now correctly centered (we thank Vladimir Marko for this important patch =)</li>
  <li>Added ADLSearch, a new search filter for browsing files, submitted/made by Henrik Engström.</li>
  <li>Local ip handling improved, so that a per-hub ip is used if nothing is entered in the active field (good for people who connect to local hubs or through different network cards)</li>
  <li>You can now use $ and | in the chat. DC++ uses the HTML standard &amp;#36; and &amp;#124; to replace them...some people might not like this because it's different than the escape sequence used in the lock, but I prefer a standard way of escaping that's not limited to numbers below 999...later on, perhaps I'll add full &amp;-escaping support so that people will be able to send all kinds of strange characters. The same escpace sequences are used in the description and email.</li>
  <li>Incoming connections are now handled in a completely different, more effective way (one thread less...). This could perhaps help with the multicpu/hyperthreading issue, but I doubt it...</li>
  <li>Fixed a crash-at-exit in the debug build</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug causing missing search results (thanks opera)</li>
  <li>Another go at the case insensitive string comp bug (tried with a queue file that was reported not to work so...)</li>
  <li>Added custom per-hub user description to favorite hubs (thanks garg)</li>
  <li>Some code cleanup and minor fixes</li>
  <li>Updated H: tag. It now looks like H:x/y/z where x, y, and z are normal, registered and op hubs respectively. It is updated roughly once a minute, but if you're disconnected, the count won't go down until the window is closed (i e hubs you're trying to reconnect to count as well, to avoid too many updates being sent to the hub). Also, note that there's a problem with the op count. All op's will first be counted as registered users, and then, when they're fully logged in the count will be updated. This is a protocol limitation and there's not much to do about it (although, most of the time you shouldn't notice, if the hub sends the op list fast enough...). This release also fixes a bug where the count was not correctly updated across all hubs.</li>
  <li>To avoid confusion when receiving text pasted from the chat, "- " is inserted whenever a line starts with '&lt;' or '[' in the main and private chat (so that it won't look like somebody else is writing a message)</li>
  <li>I think you can now use %-shortcuts in the nick when specifying user commands (%[line:] does not work tho...)</li>
  <li>Doubled interval between autosearches (2 minutes now, and 60 between each research of the same file), this to ease the bandwidth load on busy hubs</li>
  <li>Favorites, users and user commands are now saved to a separate file. The old ones will still be loaded for a few versions...</li>
  <li>Added info about current directory/selection to the file listing browser</li>
</ul>

<h2>0.233 <span style="color: gray;">(2003-02-24)</span></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Back to normal...</li>
  <li>Fixed a small bug with disappearing tray icon (thanks vladimir marko)</li>
  <li>Fixed a major bug in the case insensitive string compares resulting in 100% cpu/crashes in certain cases (specially with filenames that contain international characters). This should also fix sort problems and perhaps some search problems as well...</li>
  <li>Fixed some problems with file lists not refreshing correctly when they were being downloaded at the same time.</li>
  <li>Added option to disable the hourly automatic share refresher</li>
  <li>Fixed another Finished Files crash -- now it *should* work, I actually tested it once this time...</li>

  <li>Files containing $'s are no longer added to share (can't be downloaded later on...) (this is a protocol limitation)</li>
  <li>Changed the "download whole directory" back to the old way of working (see 0.23 notes), it turned out that i didn't like it and neither did anyone at the forum seem to do...maybe I'll think of something better later on...</li>
  <li>Fixed the move file thing (properly this time, I hope)</li>
  <li>Fixed edit boxes being enabled when option was not in logs&amp;sound settings (thanks garg)</li>
  <li>Fixed "add shared directory" modality (thanks garg)</li>
  <li>Fixed finished files crash</li>
  <li>Added an icon for the finished downloads to the toolbar (thanks garg)</li>
  <li>The main icon now contains a 48x48 icon as well (thanks garg)</li>
  <li>I hope the owner of the picture doesn't sue me / mind =)...</li>
</ul>

<h2>0.231 <span style="color: gray;">(2003-02-04)</span></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Minor speedup in the string tokenizer (silly...)</li>
  <li>Fixed missing search results when searching without type (fix also provides a tiny speedup when being searched)</li>
  <li>Fixed a silly assertion fault in the debug build</li>
  <li>Fixed the single file move crash (together with "wrong file moved", same bug)</li>
  <li>Fixed so that a user won't be granted a slot when using a "free" slot if disconnected because of the autodisconnect feature (thanks garg)</li>
  <li>The tab control now supports more than one row</li>
  <li>In the tab chevron menu, those windows that have updated (that would have been bold) now have a dot</li>
  <li>The download queue tab now goes bold if something about the queue has updated (download finished/added/failed/etc)</li>
  <li>The message edit box in the hub and pm windows now uses the font selected in the settings</li>
  <li>The finished files frame now goes bold when new items are finished</li>
  <li>Fixed some of the problems when not viewing the directory tree in the queue. There might be some bugs left tho, haven't tested...</li>
</ul>

<h2>0.23 <span style="color: gray;">(2003-01-30)</span></h2>
<ul>
  <li>New release policy, I'll wait a few days with the "new version" nag, just to see if a release is ok (doesn't have any fatal bugs in it). If you want to be on the bleeding edge, either subscribe to the release notification on sourceforge or check it every now and then. The same goes for the link on http://dcplusplus.sf.net (i e the download will only be available from http://www.sf.net/projects/dcplusplus in the files section).</li>
  <li>Removed the -Debug zip file. The debug information is now included in all public releases of DC++, this to rid the debug forums of crash reports with missing debug information. There are no performance penalties from having the debug symbols, they are loaded on demand (and if you're really deperate for disk space, you can remove the .pdb file). This of course makes the distribution download a bit bigger, an unfortunate side-effect...</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in the uninstaller (it didn't remove DCPlusPlus.pdb if installed)</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug with the user commands (PM didn't work)</li>
  <li>Some fixes to queue moving (moving to targets that already exist in queue now adds the sources of the old file to the existing target instead of just ignoring them...)</li>
  <li>Changed the way "download whole directory" works. It now downloads the files directly to the directory you've chosen, i e if you download the directory "mp3" to "x:\down" all files from "mp3" will end up in "x:\down" instead of "x:\down\mp3". This makes it easier to add files when somebody's changed the directory name but not the filenames (common with rar/ace sets). If you download to the default download directory, the directory is created (i e "default\mp3" in the example). Now I only have to decide whether I like this change or not...</li>
  <li>Cleanup of the VC7 Project files</li>
  <li>The number of uploads slots is now shown as negative if it exceeds the specified number of slots (because of auto- open or granting). We'll see how long it takes until someone reports this as a bug...</li>
  <li>Added ability to set default away message (hm...perhaps this should use the last message set?)</li>
  <li>Redesigned the appearance dialog a bit (like the advanced options now)</li>
  <li>If DC++ receives "banned" during the login phase, it'll stop automatically reconnecting (n�jd nu, nev? =)</li>
  <li>The splash screen no longer shows on the task bar (avoids flicker when loading is fast) and is not topmost (use alt-esc instead of alt-tab to switch to it if you lose it...and it can't be an option because it's shown prior to any settings being loaded).</li>
  <li>Hublist is no longer loaded in the background by default when starting the application.</li>
  <li>Fixed some proxy connection problems for the hublist (thanks Ondrea (or is it Ondra or Ondrej? =))</li>
  <li>Disabled automatic opening of the hublist. You can reenable it in the settings (this is to save some bandwidth on the hub list servers).</li>
  <li>The hublist http://dcplusplus.sourceforge.net/PublicHubList.config has been replaced by http://dcplusplus.sourceforge.net/PublicHubList.config.bz2 (the same, but bzipped, sourceforge didn't like the load on their servers...)</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug when returning compressed file search results</li>
  <li>Changed the way string compares are done, this should fix the sorting and searching problems with different charsets. All string compares are now done based on the user's locale, so searching users that use a different charset might yield unexpected results.</li>
  <li>Automatic search now searches with type if possible (to ease the load on clients)</li>
  <li>Fixed a disk full crash</li>
  <li>Added "Close all disconnected hubs" to the Window menu (thanks Kenneth Skovhede)</li>
  <li>Added /favorite to pm window to add user as a favorite user (/fav also works) (thanks Kenneth Skovhede)</li>
  <li>Added /favorite to hub window to add hub to favorite hubs (/fav also works) (thanks Kenneth Skovhede)</li>
  <li>Added "Grant slot" to transfers right-click menu (thanks Kenneth Skovhede)</li>
  <li>Added "Add to favorites" to transfers right-click menu (thanks Kenneth Skovhede)</li>
  <li>Added "Open folder" to finished downloads frame (thanks Kenneth Skovhede)</li>
  <li>Performance increase in search 1: When somebody searches with a type (document, video, etc), directories that don't contain the specified type are not searched. If people use search types a lot, this should be a significant improvement. To make this work out good, keep different file types in different directories, and smaller parts of your share will be searched. This will work better when more people have updated their clients so that autosearch uses types as well.</li>
  <li>Performance increase in search 2: Words frequently searched for are filtered out earlier in the search, so that only directories that contain a specific word are searched. This is based on the observation that a lot of the contain either their suffix (mp3 or avi for example), or some other frequently searched words. By only searching directories that for sure contain one of these words, we eliminate a lot of useless searching. In this first implementation, the list of words is static, but later on I'll add dynamic adaption, so that it's really only the most frequently words that make it to the list (thanks to Vladimir Marko for idea and research, to find out more see his post on http://dcplusplus.sf.net/forum in Protocol Alley (perfincrease 1 is based on the same kind of thinking))</li>
  <li>Fixed the hourly automatic share refresher (this is done with a low priority thread)</li>
  <li>Highest priority downloads are now always started (even if the exceed the speed &amp; max downloads limits), this way important files, file lists and small files always get downloaded...(uhm, this might have the side effect that a list download might disconnect another slot if a file change for the other one occurs during the list transfer... if this becomes a problem, I'll look into it "later" =) (completely untested...hope it doesn't break downloading =)</li>
</ul>

<h2>0.22 <span style="color: gray;">(2003-01-05)</span></h2>
<ul>
  <li>The forums are up again! On a new address though, http://dcplusplus.sf.net/forum...</li>
  <li>Added nice installer. It's big because it comes with the debug info, if you just want a zip as in the old versions, you can find it on http://sf.net/projects/dcplusplus.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug with files being added to the queue without target directory. This caused quite a lot of strange behaviour ranging from hang at startup to empty queues and crashing deletes. Hopefully, I fixed it proper, but rereport the bugs if you still have problems...</li>
  <li><span style="color: red;">*** WARNING ***</span></li>
  <li><span style="color: red;">If you upgrade to 0.22, all old queue items that are missing a directory in the</span></li>
  <li><span style="color: red;">target file-name will be removed. Don't upgrade if your queue is precious to you, and you didn't have anything</span></li>
  <li><span style="color: red;">in the default download directory box in the settings (finish it with version 0.181</span></li>

  <li><span style="color: red;">*** WARNING ***</span></li>
  <li>Added so that only files with the same extension are visible in the download to menus (this was actually done in 0.21 but I forgot to write it down...=)</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where dc++ would stop listening to incoming connections, causing connection timeouts in active mode</li>
  <li>Right-click menu now works for all nicks (even outside &lt; and &gt;)</li>
  <li>Fixed width of some status bars when font size differs from mine (I think...why would anyone want to change anyway? =)</li>
  <li>Fixed height of edit controls when font size differs from mine</li>
  <li>Added the hub the user was last connected to to the finished downloads.</li>
  <li>Added hub to the logging (see readme for available parameters)</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in speed calculation in the finished downloads frame (for resumed downloads)</li>
  <li>Last known hub is now shown in pm window when user goes offline</li>
  <li>Progress bars can now be disabled in the advanced settings</li>
  <li>Added user-customizable right-click menu commands to the hub windows (to send commands to hub bots)</li>
  <li>Advanced settings dialog remade a bit</li>
  <li>Fixed missing default setting for default download directory, making a lot of queue items miss a target directory =)</li>
  <li>Fixed case sensitivity in search right-click menu</li>
  <li>Fixed crash when opening file lists</li>
  <li>Added on-the-fly SFV checking, enable it in the advanced settings. Failed files are removed and requeued.</li>
  <li>Added sfv parameter to the logging (for full list, see readme.txt) and finished files frame</li>
  <li>Fixed startup crash when settings file was incorrectly saved (unfortunately, this makes you lose your settings tho)</li>
  <li>Fixed vc6 project file (zlib wasn't in the dependencies...come on guys, this much you should be able to figure out)</li>
  <li>If you're translating and find any untranslated string or have problems because something can't be done in your language (strange plurals?), add it to the bug report...(settings excluded)</li>

  <li>Oops, forgot to remove the transfer slowdown code when I was testing the progress bars...=)</li>
</ul>

<h2>0.21 <span style="color: gray;">(2002-12-26)</span></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Some DLLs are now delay loaded, speeding up startup and initial memory usage a tiny little bit</li>
  <li>Fixed so that the default copy-menu appears when rightclicking outside a nickname in the hub chat</li>
  <li>Added "copy nickname to clipboard" to the hub chat right click menu</li>
  <li>Fixed a directory searching bug (no directory search results when hubname contained a space...*sigh*) (thanks xeroc)</li>
  <li>Fixed returning of own search results (oops, some debug code left...)</li>
  <li>More work on the queue internals (should hopefully fix the bug when an item is reported as running even though it's not)</li>
  <li>Fixed some issues with 0-byte files in the queue (an unnecessary disconnection occurred)</li>
  <li>More work on the queue window; File lists now have a separate folder, fixed viewing of right-click menus so that they only show the commands that actually work depending on selection count.</li>
  <li>Fixed / Improved the sorting of the transfer status. It is now always sorted as running downloads - connecting downloads - uploads (unless you flip the sort order...doh!)</li>
  <li>Added beautiful progress bars to the transfers area (hej ullis =)</li>
  <li>Added exact byte size to the search window</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug with directory downloading from other dc++ users (that use the .bz filelist)</li>
  <li>Incomplete file lists are now deleted on failure.</li>
  <li>Fixed the socks resolve setting bug (somebody will have to try the DNS resolution itself though...can't do)</li>
  <li>Added "no-tree-mode" to the queue. The queue window then shows the full list of queueitems (if possible, the number of items it can show depends on your operating system)</li>
  <li>The search window now uses non-colored icons (system or dc++), I didn't like the coloring anyway, will think of something better later on...</li>
  <li>Some minor changes to the settings dialogs...preparing for making translation possible...</li>
  <li>Fixed port changing bug (DC++ would still listen to the old port until restarted)</li>
  <li>Added debug-build-type error reporting to the release builds as well. Now, if supported by the OS, dc++ will emit a useful bug report whenever it crashes. If you have a lot of problems with dc++ crashing, you should download the debug information from www.sourceforge.net/projects/dcplusplus, and then, when reporting the bug, include the generated "extenedinfo.txt" file. Do not report the crash unless you have this file and have downloaded the debug information file. The extended tracing code is in part written by Zoltan Csizmadia (zoltan_csizmadia@yahoo.com), found it on some web site. (</li>
  <li>Added moving of files in the queue (experimental)</li>
  <li>Fixed bug when a '\' was not added to the temp downloads directory</li>
  <li>Right-click menu works for joins and parts as well now (changed the format of the join/part message =)</li>
  <li>Fixed a lockup bug (transfer speeds would not update among other things...)</li>

<h2>0.20 <span style="color: gray;">(2002-12-06)</span></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Collective thanks to all who have donated $$$ to me, I didn't think people would do it, but they actually have, amounts ranging from $1 to $200...keep 'em coming =) (keep in mind tho that paypal steals 30 cents and some percentage (4 i think) from me when you pay with a credit card). Oh, I think you can also donate in � (euros) now, which is, of course, my preferred currency =)</li>
  <li>The forum and lichlord.org are currently down for maintenance, and the owner is waiting for new network equipment. I would open an alternative forum if I could get the old posts, but because all network connections to the server are broken it's difficult to get the old posts out of it for the moment (physical access to the server is somewhat limited). For the most desperate ones, I opened a new conference on sourceforge (where the old forums were) that you can use, or if you feel like it, try one of the forums that people have put up on their own (I won't read them though, don't have time). Anyway, lichlord should be up soon I hope...</li>
  <li>This release is completely untested (more or less, i'm in the third world (italy...amazing that this country made it to the G7, and is still actually there...)), and is most problably not very stable. If it crashes, I don't want to know about it unless you're using the debug version (that most probably doesn't work with w98), that generates an exceptioninfo.txt file. If you report a crash bug ("unhandled exception"), make sure you include this file in the report, otherwise it's a waste of your time writing and my time deleting. I do not recommend this version for those who are comfortable with 0.181...</li>
  <li>I've decided to clear the bug and feature request forum of all posts, regardless of whether they have been fixed/implemented or not, because of the ridiculous amount of duplicates. I apologize to those that made valid, new fresh and interesting requests, but because of all double-posting idiots, I can't keep up with things. I've tagged all the closed requests as "out of date", and I kindly ask the original authors to reopen their posts if they still consider them valid and non-duplicate. You can find them by browsing for closed posts. Also, before posting a feature request, check that the feature is not already implemented (by looking in the settings for instance). It is not exactly a sign of intelligence to suggest features that already exist...and there seems to be an alarming number of stupid people out there...</li>
  <li>The CVS is not up to date (because of the retarded firewall at my school...)</li>
  <li>Clicking on a users name with ctrl pressed opens a pm window (thanks opera)</li>
  <li>Clicking on a users name with shift downloads the users file list (thanks opera)</li>
  <li>Right-clicking on a name in the chat will bring up the user menu (thanks opera)</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in the startup procedure resulting in a crash sometimes</li>
  <li>Fixed bug that window size was set to 0 when dc++ was turned of while being minimized, resulting in "missing dc++ window" on startup</li>
  <li>Added socks5 support (more or less...no gssapi support), works like passive mode. M:5 means socks5 in the &lt;++ tag. (No, I won't be adding socks4 as it doesn't support UDP forwarding)</li>
  <li>Myinfo is now sent out roughly every 1-2 minutes if something has changed hub-count-wise (was 10-20 min before)</li>
  <li>Added directory downloading (from the search window, unfinished, not sure if it works, experimental, kids, don't do it at home, dangerous...)</li>
  <li>Fixed some random bugs and very uncommon memory leaks</li>
  <li>Fixed the ordering in the right-click menus so that "browse" and recent dirs appear first</li>
  <li>Added directory (folder) searching</li>
  <li>.ogg and .wma are now returned when someone searches for audio files</li>
  <li>.txt and .nfo are now returned when someone searches for documents</li>
  <li>.divx is now returned when someone searches for videos</li>
  <li>.gif and .jpg (!) are now returned when someone searches for pictures (oops, must have missed them when reverse engineering the original .exe...=)</li>
  <li>Note; the extended search results only work if the client being searched is a new dc++...</li>
  <li>Improved XML handling (much less memory used on queue load)</li>
  <li>Speeded up queue save a lot, shouldn't take any notable amount of memory either (for those with large (10000+ files) queues), although if you have a queue that large you should perhaps consider your queuing strategy...</li>
  <li>Added total bytes and average speed to finished downloads window</li>
  <li>A random free port between 1025 and 32000 is now used in active mode, unless a port specifically has been set. This port is changed on every restart to avoid problems with networks where traffic on certain ports is limited or banned. If you have a firewall that requires a certain port to be used (incoming traffic), go to the settings and set it (your best pick is a random one in the above noted range) (setting not kept from previous version). DC++ requires that both TCP and UDP data can reach the client on this port. To find out the ip/port currently in use, type /connection in a hub window.</li>
  <li>Failed downloads are now not put at the beginning to avoid having partial unfinished downloads</li>
  <li>The queue window now has a tree instead of a list to the left</li>
  <li>Added a common controls version check to rid the support forum of (at least some of the) stupid questions</li>
  <li>Spaces are now trimmed from most ip addresses</li>
  <li>Added O: in the &lt;++ tag, it means that the user is using the speedautoopen slot feature, and the number is the kb/s setting. IMHO this is a much better way of measuring the whole slots thing, and in future releases S: may become optional if the min upload speed feature is turned on (a good topic for the dc++ forums...). Uhm, in other words, if the current total upload speed of a user is lower than the number after O:, dc++ will automatically open another slot.</li>
  <li>Some internal changes in the queue handling (might cause trouble, untested)</li>
  <li>The notepad content is now saved in a file called "Notepad.txt" in the dc++ main directory instead of the xml file</li>
  <li>Fixed the file search and made it search a bit more accoring to the sort order</li>
  <li>Fixed so that the same string won't be added to the recent searches list</li>
  <li>Queue is now indexed by a map instead of a hash resulting in slightly more cpu use (if you have a huge queue) but queue is ordered accoring to filename to avoid partially downloaded directories (when saved, queue is now sorted by target location and will be downloaded in that order when reloaded from disk...)</li>
  <li>Fixed so that focus is correctly set to the message input edit box in the hub chat window when changing back to dc++</li>
  <li>Recreates filelisting if it's missing on request from another user (if it's been deleted that is...). This effectively stops the "delete filelist"-cheat.</li>
  <li>Added automatic disconnection of uploads if a user leaves the hub. This is a somewhat controversial feature that disconnects any uploads to a user if the user leaves the hub (or is kicked...). If an upload is cancelled in this way, a free slot is granted to the user being kicked, in case that the user was unwillingly disconnected from the hub and returns within 10 minutes. This effectively prevents the "jump into hub, start a bunch of downloads, and exit the hub"-cheat, without the cheater being able to do anything about it. It is off by default, turn on in the settings.</li>
  <li>Alt-S sends a message in the chats</li>
  <li>The PM window now correctly shows when a user goes on/offline and doesn't send the message if the user is offline (so that you don't lose it from the edit box)</li>
</ul>

  <li>Main window state (maximized and so on) and size are saved on exit (and restored I think =)</li>
  <li>Kick messages are now correctly filtered (even when status line in chat setting is on)</li>

  <li>Fixed the speed display of very fast transfers (&gt;4 mb/s)</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where a bad file list could cause dc++ to crash</li>
  <li>Fixed the loading of list view column orders</li>
  <li>Added so that doubleclicking on usernames in the main chat (&lt;nick&gt;) will select the user in the user list</li>
  <li>Added so that doubleclicking words starting with http://, www. and ftp:// will open the link</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug with bad hublist server names (empty ones, not starting with http://...)</li>
  <li>Added WM_ENDSESSION handling so that the queue and settings are saved when shutting down the computer</li>
  <li>Added auto-away on minimize option</li>
  <li>Fixed restoring window to maximized state after minimizing to tray</li>
  <li>Added a "small send buffer" option that should help users that are having download problems when others leech from them...basically, this makes the outgoing packet size smaller (1k instead of 16k), leaving more bandwidth for acks to flow through...it also makes sending less efficient, specially for high bandwidth users, so don't turn it on unless you have to...hard disk reading performance will be worse as well with this option enabled...</li>
  <li>Added paypal-donate menu option to help</li>

  <li>Fixed some queue random crash bugs</li>
  <li>Fixed the wrong transfer icon bug (I think...)</li>
  <li>Improved overall queue performance (again...=)</li>
  <li>Fixed a small bug that caused some unnecessary traffic to the hub (nmdc works this way, every time a user logs on, his info is requested from the hub, but this request is unnecessary as the info is sent out automatically to all users, in nmhub v1.0.25 at least...complain if I'm wrong...)</li>
  <li>Fixed the long shutdown time when a _very_ slow transfer was in progress</li>

  <li>Added some advanced logging options (log format now customizable)</li>
  <li>Found a bug in the msvc7 optimizer...after a small workaround, my vc7-compiled build seems quite stable</li>

  <li>Fixed the &lt;16kb and file list extra slots bug</li>
  <li>Added some stuff to the search spy (useless features are the best...=)</li>

  <li>Added file searching to directory listings</li>
  <li>Improved the autosearch algorithm a little bit</li>
  <li>Fixed some issues with autoconnecting to favorite hubs</li>
  <li>Changed the way rollback works, it is now more tightly integrated with write buffer size. Write buffer size will now be used as a cutoff, so that the last &lt;writebuffersize&gt; bytes will be removed and then &lt;rollbacksize&gt; bytes will be compared to see if it's the same file. Recommended values for write buffer is 64kb or your hard disk cluster size (Low-speed connectees might wish to use a lower buffer, as it this many bytes are redownloaded if the file has to be resumed). If you set write buffering to 0 the old (pre-writebuffering) routines will be used which are still considered safer (when ++ crashes...). Recommended rollback is 1024 bytes, or 4096 if you want to be extra safe.</li>
  <li>Fixed search for alternates bug</li>

<h2>0.122 <span style="color: gray;">(2002-01-16)</span></h2>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed resume bug</li>
  <li>Fixed rollback bug</li>
  <li>Fixed upload slots bug</li>
  <li>Fixed some minor download queue bugs</li>
  <li>Tried a different approach to the download problems in 0.12. When implementing different user nicks on different hubs, I had to change some of the download code to something that I'm not sure will work with the original client, that's why you've had so many problems with 0.12. Please remember that this is still alpha software, and that I release these versions this frequently so that 1) you have the latest of the latest and 2) so that I have someone who does the testing for me to speed up development...anyway, keep on reporting them bugs and one day, they will be gone!!</li>
