<h1><a name="connection"></a>Connection Settings</h1>
There are three modes of connection in DC++: Active, Passive, or
SOCKS5. If you have problems configuring them, or problems connecting
please refer to the <a href="faq_activemode.html">FAQ</a>.<br>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <dt style="text-decoration: underline;">Active</dt>
  <dd> In active mode, DC++ needs to make outbound TCP connections and
send UDP packets to other machines, as well as receive inbound TCP
connections and inbound UDP packets. TCP is used for file transfers and
UDP is used for file search results. Remote DC++ clients will return a
maximum of 10 search hits to an active user. A user in active mode will
have M:A in their <a href="plusplus_tag.html">DC++ tag</a>.&nbsp; Use <a
 href="faq_activemode.html">this guide</a> to set up active mode.<dl>
      <dt>IP</dt>
      <dd>DC++ will automatically detect and use your local IP. If you
are behind a router (or your IP is otherwise <a
 href="non-routable.html">non-routable</a>) you will need to put in
your external IP here. If you put a DNS name here, DC++ will try to
resolve it into an IP address before use.</dd>
      <dt>TCP Port</dt>
      <dd>This is the port that DC++ listens on for incoming client
connections. If this setting is blank, DC++ will use a random port
between 1025 and 32000.</dd>
      <dt>UDP Port</dt>
      <dd>This is the port that DC++ listens on for incoming search
results. If this setting is blank, DC++ will use a random port between
1025 and 32000. </dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
  <dt style="text-decoration: underline;">Passive</dt>
  <dd>In passive mode, DC++ will only make outbound connections to
other users. All searches will be sent through the hub, and search
results will be returned through the hub as well.&nbsp;Remote DC++
clients will return a maximum of 5 search hits for a passive user.
Passive users cannot download from other passive users. Passive mode is
an extra strain on hubs, so please do not use it unless you must. DC++
users in passive mode will have M:P in their <a
 href="plusplus_tag.html">DC++ tag</a>.</dd>
  <dt style="text-decoration: underline;">SOCKS5</dt>
  <dd> In SOCKS mode, DC++ will make a connection to hub through an
existing SOCKS5 proxy server. Connections to users will also be made
through this proxy server. The caveats for passive mode also apply
here. SOCKS5 proxies are not the same as HTTP proxies. DC++'s SOCKS5
support does <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span>
include GSSAPI.<br>
    <dl>
      <dt>Socks IP</dt>
      <dd>This is the IP, not hostname, of your SOCKS5 server.</dd>
      <dt>Port</dt>
      <dd>The port that your SOCKS5 server runs on. The default value
is 1080.</dd>
      <dt>Username</dt>
      <dd>Username for the SOCKS5 proxy; may be required. </dd>
      <dt>Password</dt>
      <dd>Password for the SOCKS5 proxy; may be required. </dd>
      <dt>Use SOCKS5 server to resolve hostnames</dt>
      <dd>When checked (the default), DC++ will use the SOCKS5 proxy to
resolve hostnames into IP addresses. </dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
