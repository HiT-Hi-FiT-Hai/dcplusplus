<h1><a name="connection"></a>Connection Settings</h1>
This page has options on it that will let you properly configure DC++'s
options for incoming and outgoing connections. Your incoming connection
type must be properly chosen for downloading to work.<br>
<h2>Incoming connection settings</h2>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <dt>Direct Connection</dt>
  <dd cshelp=IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_DIRECT>Select this mode if your computer is hooked directly to the
internet. Do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span>
select this mode if you have a router (firewall) or a software firewall.</dd>
  <dt>Firewall with UPnP</dt>
  <dd cshelp=IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_FIREWALL_UPNP>Select this mode if you are
behind a firewall that supports
the UPnP standard for program auto-configuration. DC++ will
automatically open the ports it needs and obtain your external IP
address. This mode is not available on operating systems
before
Windows XP, as it was the first version to have UPnP
support. There is a <a href="faq_upnp.html">guide
to configuring UPnP</a>.</dd>
  <dt>Firewall with manual port
forwarding</dt>
  <dd cshelp=IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_FIREWALL_NAT>Select this mode if you are behind a firewall (router), and will
set up the TCP and UDP port forwarding on your own. You <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span> need to specify the
external IP address of your router using the setting below if you want
downloads to work properly. Use <a href="faq_activemode.html">this
guide</a> to set up active mode.</dd>
  <dt>Firewall (passive, last resort)</dt>
  <dd cshelp=IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_FIREWALL_PASSIVE>Select this mode if none of the previous options apply. In this
mode, DC++ will not try to make inbound connections, only outbound
ones. This mode carries some limitations:</dd>
</dl>
<ul style="margin-left: 120px;">
  <li>only 5 results per user will be returned in response to searches</li>
  <li>you will not be able to download from other passive users</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">Options</h3>
<dl style="margin-left: 80px;">
  <dt>TCP Port</dt>
  <dd cshelp=IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_PORT_TCP>This is the port that DC++ listens on for incoming client
connections. If this setting is blank, DC++ will use a random port
between 1025 and 32000.</dd>
  <dt>UDP Port</dt>
  <dd cshelp=IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_PORT_UDP>This is the port that DC++ listens on for incoming search
results. If this setting is blank, DC++ will use a random port between
1025 and 32000.</dd>
  <dt>TLS Port</dt>
  <dd cshelp=IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_PORT_TLS>This is the port that DC++ listens on for <a href="settings_certs.html">TLS</a> connections.
 If this setting is blank, DC++ will use a random port between
1025 and 32000.</dd>
  <dt>External / WAN IP</dt>
  <dd cshelp=IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_EXTERNAL_IP>If you're directly connected to the internet, DC++ will tell remote users to connect to your local IP.
Fill in this box <span style="font-weight: bold;">only</span> if you need to override the auto-detection.
Ordinarily, only users behind a home router (NAT device) will need to fill in this box. If you put a DNS name
here, DC++ will try to resolve it into an IP address before use.</dd>
  <dt>Don't allow hub/UPnP to override</dt>
  <dd cshelp=IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_OVERRIDE>Enable this to always use the IP address in "External / WAN IP",
and not let either UPnP or connected hubs change it.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Outgoing connection settings</h2>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <dt>Direct connection</dt>
  <dd cshelp=IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_DIRECT_OUT>Select this mode if you can make unrestricted outbound
connections. This includes connecting to any IP address on any port.</dd>
  <dt>SOCKS5</dt>
  <dd cshelp=IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_SOCKS5>Select this mode if you want to make outbound connections through
a SOCKS proxy. The caveats for Firewall (passive) mode also apply here.
SOCKS5 proxies are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span>
the same as HTTP proxies. DC++'s SOCKS5 support does <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> include GSSAPI.</dd>
</dl>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">Options</h3>
<dl style="margin-left: 80px;">
  <dt>Socks IP</dt>
  <dd cshelp=IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_SOCKS_SERVER>This is the IP, not host name, of your SOCKS5 server.</dd>
  <dt>Port</dt>
  <dd cshelp=IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_SOCKS_PORT>The port that your SOCKS5 server runs on. The default is 1080.</dd>
  <dt>Login</dt>
  <dd cshelp=IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_SOCKS_USER>Login name for the SOCKS5 proxy; may be required.</dd>
  <dt>Password</dt>
  <dd cshelp=IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_SOCKS_PASSWORD>Password for the SOCKS5 proxy; may be required.</dd>
  <dt>Use SOCKS5 server to resolve host names</dt>
  <dd cshelp=IDH_SETTINGS_NETWORK_SOCKS_RESOLVE>Enable this to use the SOCKS5 proxy, instead of the local name
server, to resolve host names into IP addresses.</dd>
