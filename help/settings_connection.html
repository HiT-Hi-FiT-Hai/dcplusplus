<h1><a name="connection"></a>Connection Settings</h1>
This page has options on it that will let you properly configure DC++'s
options for incoming and outgoing connections.<br>
<h2>Incoming connection settings</h2>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <dt>Direct Connection</dt>
  <dd>Select this mode&nbsp;
if your computer is hooked directly up to
the computer. &nbsp;Do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span>
select this mode if you have a router (firewall) or a software firewall.</dd>
  <dt>Firewall with UPnP</dt>
  <dd>Select this mode if you are
behind a&nbsp;firewall that supports
the UPnP standard for program auto-configuration. &nbsp;DC++ will
automatically open the ports it needs and obtain your external IP
address. &nbsp;This mode is not available on operating systems
before
Windows XP, as it&nbsp;was the first version to have&nbsp;UPnP
support. There is a <a href="faq_upnp.html">guide to configuring UPnP</a>.</dd>
  <dt>Firewall with manual port
forwarding</dt>
  <dd>Select this mode if you are
behind a firewall (router), and will
set up the TCP and UDP&nbsp;port forwarding on your own.
&nbsp;You <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span>
need to specify
the&nbsp;external &nbsp;IP address of your router using the
setting
below if you want downloads to work properly. &nbsp;Use <a
 href="faq_activemode.html">this guide</a>
to set up active mode.</dd>
  <dt>Firewall (passive, last
resort)</dt>
  <dd>Select this mode if none of
the previous options apply. &nbsp;In
this mode, DC++ will not try to make inbound connections, only outbound
ones. &nbsp;This mode carries some limitations:</dd>
</dl>
<ul style="margin-left: 120px;">
  <li>only 5 results per user will
be returned in response to searches</li>
  <li>you will not be able to
download from other passive users</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">Options</h3>
<dl style="margin-left: 80px;">
  <dt>TCP Port</dt>
  <dd>This is the port that DC++
listens on for incoming client
connections. If this setting is blank, DC++ will use a random port
between 1025 and 32000.</dd>
  <dt>UDP Port</dt>
  <dd>This is the port that DC++
listens on for incoming search
results. If this setting is blank, DC++ will use a random port between
1025 and 32000.</dd>
  <dt>External / WAN IP</dt>
  <dd>Normally, DC++ will
automatically detect and use your local IP.
Fill in this box only if you need to override the auto-detection.
&nbsp;Ordinarily, you will only need to fill in this box if you're
behind a router and are using&nbsp;manual port forwarding.
&nbsp;If you
put a DNS name here, DC++ will try to
resolve it into an IP address before use.</dd>
  <dt>Don't allow hub/UPnP to
override</dt>
  <dd>Enable this to always use
the IP address in "External / WAN IP,"
and not let either UPnP or connected hubs change it.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Outgoing connection settings</h2>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <dt>Direct connection</dt>
  <dd>Select this mode if you can
make unrestricted outbound
connections. &nbsp;This includes connecting to any IP address on
any
port.</dd>
  <dt>SOCKS5</dt>
  <dd>Select this mode if you want
to make outbound connections through a SOCKS proxy. The caveats for
Firewall (passive) mode also apply here. SOCKS5 proxies are <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span>
the same as HTTP proxies. DC++'s SOCKS5 support does <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span>
include GSSAPI.</dd>
</dl>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">Options</h3>
<dl style="margin-left: 80px;">
  <dt>Socks IP</dt>
  <dd>This is the IP, not host
name, of your SOCKS5 server.</dd>
  <dt>Port</dt>
  <dd>The port that your SOCKS5
server runs on. The default
is 1080.</dd>
  <dt>Login</dt>
  <dd>Login&nbsp;name for the
SOCKS5 proxy; may be required. </dd>
  <dt>Password</dt>
  <dd>Password for the SOCKS5
proxy; may be required. </dd>
  <dt>Use SOCKS5 server to resolve
host names</dt>
  <dd>Enable this to use the
SOCKS5 proxy, instead of the local
name server, to
resolve host names into IP addresses. </dd>
</dl>
