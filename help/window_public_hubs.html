<h2>Configured Public Hub lists</h2>
In the dropdown, you may select different hublists you want to see. Press the 'Refresh' button to download a fresh version of the hublist.

If you click on 'Configure', you will be able to change, add and remove hublists. The order in 'Configured Public Hub lists' determine the order hublists are displayed in the dropdown mentioned above.
