<h2>Filter</h2>
Here, you can filter the hublist so you will only see specific hubs in the hublist. Eg, selecting 'address' in the drop down, and writing "foo" in the filter, will only display hubs that have "foo" in their address. 
<h2>Configured Public Hub lists</h2>
In the dropdown, you may select different hublists you want to see.
<br>
If you click on 'Configure', you will be able to change, add and remove hublists. The order in 'Configured Public Hub lists' determines the order hublists are displayed in the dropdown mentioned above.
