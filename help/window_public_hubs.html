<h2>Filter</h2>
<span cshelp="IDH_PUBLIC_HUBS_FILTER">
Here, you can filter the hublist so you will only see specific hubs in the hublist. Eg, selecting 'address' in the drop down, and writing "foo" in the filter, will only display hubs that have "foo" in their address.
</span>
<h2>Configured Public Hub lists</h2>
<span cshelp="IDH_PUBLIC_HUBS_LISTS">
In the dropdown, you may select different hublists you want to see. If the hublist was downloaded before you will have the cached version displayed. Click Refresh to get the fresh version of the hublist. 
<br/>
If you click on 'Configure', you will be able to change, add and remove hublists. The order in <a href="dialog_public_hub_lists.html">Configured Public Hub Lists</a> determines the order hublists are displayed in the dropdown mentioned above.

<h2>Refresh</h2>
<span cshelp="IDH_PUBLIC_HUBS_REFRESH">
Download a fresh version of the hublist. If the download fails click Refresh again to get the next available hublist in the dropdown.

to get hublists by default. This improves reliability and makes it possible to download hublists even when the original hublist server is out of service.
