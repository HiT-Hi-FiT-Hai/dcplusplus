<h1>Queue settings</h1>
<h2>Autoprio settings</h2>
<span cshelp=IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_AUTOPRIO>
Autoprio allows setting the queue item priority automatically when
adding it to the download queue. A user can then change the priority of
a file manually.<br>
Priority conditions are checked from the Highest to the Lowest
priority, when assigning a priority to a new queue item. A zero means
that the given priority level won't be used - except Normal priority,
which is the default priority. Lowest possible value for the Highest
priority is 16 KiB.
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<dl>
  <dt>Highest prio max size</dt>
  <dd cshelp=IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_PRIO_HIGHEST>Files with the same or under the entered size will be set to
Highest as priority. (default: 64 KiB) </dd>
  <dt>Normal prio max size</dt>
  <dd cshelp=IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_PRIO_NORMAL>Files with the same or under the entered size, but above Highest
and High prio max size, will be set to Normal as priority. (default: 0
KiB) </dd>
  <dt>High prio max size</dt>
  <dd cshelp=IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_PRIO_HIGH>Files with the same or under the entered size, but above Highest
prio max size, will be set to High as priority. (default: 0 KiB)</dd>
  <dt>Low prio max size</dt>
  <dd cshelp=IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_PRIO_LOW>Files with the same or under the entered size, but above Highest,
High and Normal prio max size, will be set to Low as priority.
(default: 0 KiB)</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<h2>Autodrop settings</h2>
<span cshelp=IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_AUTODROP>
Autodrop allows automatical removal (or disconnecting) of slow download
sources. By default, slow sources are removed.<br>
All of these autodrop options are necessary to estimate and
disconnect/drop sources properly.
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<dl>
  <dt>Drop sources below x B/s</dt>
  <dd cshelp=IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_AUTODROP_SPEED>If the download speed of a file is below the entered value, the
source will be dropped. (default: 1024 B/s) </dd>
  <dt>Min elapsed</dt>
  <dd cshelp=IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_AUTODROP_ELAPSED>Amount of time (in seconds) that has to pass since the download
started before a source can be dropped. (default: 15 s) </dd>
  <dt>Min sources online</dt>
  <dd cshelp=IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_AUTODROP_MINSOURCES>Minimum amount of sources before any sources will be dropped.
(default: 1) </dd>
  <dt>Check every x s</dt>
  <dd cshelp=IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_AUTODROP_INTERVAL>Check every x second(s) if the source is slow. (default: 10 s) </dd>
  <dt>Max inactivity</dt>
  <dd cshelp=IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_AUTODROP_INACTIVITY>This is the maximal time since the last chunk of data for the
file was recieved. It is meant to improve speed measurement accuracy
and to prevent dropping sources that are going to be disconnected only
because of their current inactivity. (default: 10 s) </dd>
  <dt>Min filesize</dt>
  <dd cshelp=IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_AUTODROP_FILESIZE>Minimum filesize before sources will be dropped (in KiB).
(default: 0 KiB)</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<h2>Other queue options</h2>
To enable autodrop, turn on either "Autodrop slow sources for all queue
items" or "Remove slow file lists" (or both of them).
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<dl>
  <dt>Set lowest prio for newly added files larger than Low prio size</dt>
  <dd>With this enabled, files that are larger than Low prio max size
are set to Lowest as priority. If disabled, the files will be set to
Normal as priority. </dd>
  <dt>Autodrop slow sources for all queued items (except file lists)</dt>
  <dd>This option removes the slow sources for all queue items (except
file lists).</dd>
  <dt>Remove slow filelists</dt>
  <dd>With this option enabled, DC++ will delete a file list whose speed
was recognized as too slow. </dd>
  <dt>Don't remove the source when autodropping, only disconnect</dt>
  <dd>With this option enabled, sources will only be disconnected but
not removed from the queue.</dd>
  <dt><a name="autosearchdl"></a>Automatically Search for Alternative Download Locations</dt>
  <dd>Every few minutes, the client will search for files in your
Download Queue to find more download locations (more users/sources). If
the download was started with a TTH root hash available, the autosearch
will find exact matches by searching via hash. Otherwise, the
autosearch will try to find matches by searching with a slightly
modified version of the filename.</dd>
  <dt>Automatically Match Queue for Auto Search Hits</dt>
  <dd>Enable to automatically download a user's list and match them as
sources for files in your Download Queue when they've been discovered
as a source for one of the files you're downloading. If you download
files in sets, that user is probably a source for many more files
you're downloading. <span style="font-style: italic;">Enable if unsure.
The drawbacks are that it might add slower sources, possibly increasing
the time needed to complete a download, and that you'll download a lot
of file lists.</span></dd>
  <dt>Skip Zero-Byte Files</dt>
  <dd>When this option is enabled, any zero byte files you try to
download will be silently skipped. Sometimes empty files contain
information through their naming. However every file, even an empty
one, will consume some drive space.</dd>
  <dt>Don't download files already in share</dt>
  <dd>This option will stop you from downloading files which already
exist in one of your shared directories.</dd>
  <dt>Don't download files already in queue</dt>
  <dd>This option will stop you from downloading files which already
exist in your queue.</dd>
