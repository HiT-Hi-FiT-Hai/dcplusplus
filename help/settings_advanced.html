<h1>Advanced</h1>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <dt><a name="autoaway"></a>Auto-away on Minimize</dt>
  <dd>Switch to away mode whenever the client is minimized (and to back
whenever restored).</dd>
  <dt>Automatically Follow Redirects</dt>
  <dd>A connected hub can send out a redirect request, asking your
client to disconnect from the current hub and joining another one.
Enable this to automatically join that other hub. (You will be
disconnected from the current hub no matter what.) If you leave it
disabled, you can use the Follow Redirect button to manually follow the
redirect.</dd>
  <dt>Clear Search Box After Each Search</dt>
  <dd>After each search, your search terms will be cleared. The last
terms will be accessible through the drop-down. You can set how many terms that you want to save by using <a href="settings_expert.html#searchhistory">Search history</a>.</dd>
  <dt>Keep Duplicate Files in Your File List</dt>
  <dd>Decides whether to remove duplicate files from your share or to
list them but subtract their size from your total reported share size.
Duplicate files never count towards your share size, no matter what
this is set to.</dd>
  <dt><a name="registrydchubadc"></a>Register with Windows to Handle dchub:// and adc:// URL Links</dt>
  <dd>When set, DC++ will be the default handler for all dchub:// and
adc://
links. These links can appear on web pages, internet shortcuts on your
computer, or be&nbsp;typed and run as a program from
the&nbsp;Start&nbsp;Menu. Disable this if you prefer for a different
application to handle Direct Connect hub links. Disabling will make
DC++ remove the keys from the Windows registry.<br>
  </dd>
  <dt><a name="registrymagnet"></a>Register with Windows to Handle manget: URI Links</dt>
  <dd>When set, DC++ will register itself to handle magnet: links.
These links will let you search the Direct Connect network for a file
matching a given file hash, given that the magnet link contains
information appropriate for the Direct Connect network. DC++ uses
Magnethandler to give a choice between supported P2P applications when
magnet.exe is installed on the system or is located in the
application's directory. Disabling will make DC++ remove the key from
the Windows registry.<br>
  </dd>
  <dt>Don't Delete File Lists When Exiting</dt>
  <dd>If this option is disabled, DC++ will delete the contents of the
file list directory, where file lists are stored, when
exiting.&nbsp;However, you can open already downloaded file lists
instead of downloading them again. These file lists have a chance of
being out of date, but for users on slow connections, keeping file
lists can save time. <em>Since the file list isn't curent, don't be
surprised if the files you enqueue to download have been removed by the
user, or moved.</em></dd>
  <dt><a name="disconnect"></a>Automatically Disconnect Users Who
Leave the Hub</dt>
  <dd>The Direct Connect spirit is all about sharing. You are only
sharing when you are connected to one or more hubs. In the past, users
of questionable integrity and spirit logged onto a hub, selected a
download, and disconnected from the hub again. If everyone did that,
there would be nothing to download. Enable this option to avert that
kind of behaviour. <em>Note that you might need to disable this option
if you're connected to a hub that has a bad connection. The user will
regain his/her slot if he/she reconnects within 10 minutes, but you
might have opened up another slot for another user in the mean time.
This could cause a situation where you have way more upload slots in
use than you selected in the settings. Also, if you quit the hub,
people downloading from you will not be disconnected.</em></dd>
  <dt><a name="progressbar"></a>Show Progress Bars for Transfers</dt>
  <dd>Enable this if you have CPU cycles to spare, and you will get
colored progress bars in the Transfer View.</dd>
  <dt><a name="sfvcheck"></a>Enable Automatic SFV Checking</dt>
  <dd>Simple File Verification (SFV) is a scheme in which a set of
files are accompanied by a so-called sfv-file which contains CRC32
checksums of each file. If there is an sfv-file included, DC++ will
check that your download is free of corruption and retry the download
that wasn't the case.</dd>
  <dt>Don't Send the Away Message to Bots</dt>
  <dd>When in away mode, don't send the away message to users that
appear to be bots. Having this option disabled is very annoying if you
get messages from bots that link chat from multiple users (the most
well known example is the Operator Chat facility found in many hubs).
Users are judged to be bots if they have an empty Connection type. <span style="font-style: italic;">Enable if unsure.</span></dd>

  <dt><a name="break"></a>Break on First ADLSearch Match</dt>
  <dd>If you're using the <a href="window_adlsearch.html">ADLSearch</a>
features, keeping this option enabled will make a file show up in only
the first search it matches. If disabled, it may appear multiple times,
if it matches more than one search. <span style="font-style: italic;">Disable
if unsure.</span></dd>
  <dt>Enable Safe and Compressed Transfers</dt>
  <dd>When transfering data with a compatible client, DC++ will try to
use ZLIB compression with integrity checks. This uses some CPU cycles,
but can dramatically speed up transfers of uncompressed files as well
as ensure file integrity (reduce the chance of corruption to near zero).<span style="font-style: italic;">Enable if unsure.</span></dd>

  <dt>Accept Custom User Command From Hub</dt>
  <dd>This option lets you enable or disable DC++'s ability to retrieve
custom commands from a remote&nbsp;hub. Custom User Commands may show
when you click on the hub's tab, or on a user in the Transfer View,
Search Window, or User List, and can enable you to read the rules,
perform operator functions, interact with hub bots, etcetera.</dd>
  <dt>Send Unknown /commands to the Hub</dt>
  <dd>Enable this to send <a href="chat_commands.html">/commands</a>
that DC++ does not recognize to the hub as normal chat.</dd>
  <dt>Add Finished Files to Share Instantly</dt>
  <dd>If you download files directly to a shared directory, enabling
this option will add the files to your share as soon as they're
finished. Searches will return the file, and users can download it. It
will not appear in your file list until the next refresh.</dd>
  <dt>Use CTRL for line history</dt>
  <dd>Press up arrow while holding down CTRL to scroll through line
history. If not enabled, up arrow will be enough.</dd>
  <dt>Don't automatically disconnect favorite users who leave the hub</dt>
  <dd>With this option enabled, and <a href="window_settings_advanced.html#disconnect">Automatically disconnect users who leave the hub</a>, users who are in your <a href="favorite_users.html">Favorite users</a> page are not disconnected.</dd>
  <dt>Show shell menu where possible</dt>
  <dd>This allow DC++ to display Explorer's shell menu for files, whenever possible.</dd>
