<h1>Hub</h1>
<h2>Main chat window (left)</h2>
<span cshelp=IDH_HUB_CHAT>
The main chat window displays messages sent by the hub. You can chat with other users in this "public area" by writing a message in the field below the main chat and pressing either Enter or Alt+S to send your message. You may also use <a href="chat_commands.html">/commands</a> (send /help to list those available).<br/>
Note; this is not the place to search for files. Open a <a href="window_search.html">Search window</a> to do that.
</span>
<h2>Users list (right)</h2>
List of users connected to the hub. You can right-click them to see the menu options available for each.<br>
<a href="faq_different_icons.html">Follow this link to see what the different icons mean</a>.<br>
The users list can be shown or hidden by using the checkbox available in the bottom right of the hub window, in the status bar, right below the users list filter. When that checkbox is checked, the users list is shown.
<h2>Field to write a message (bottom left)</h2>
<span cshelp=IDH_HUB_MESSAGE>
Write a message here to chat with other users connected to the hub. You can press either Enter or Alt+S to send your message. You may also use <a href="chat_commands.html">/commands</a> (send /help to list those available).
</span>
<h2>Users list filter (bottom right)</h2>
<span cshelp=IDH_HUB_FILTER>
Here, you can filter the users list so you will only see specific users. Eg, selecting 'Nick' in the drop down, and writing "foo" in the filter, will only display users that have "foo" in their nick.<br>
Note; users will only be visually filtered, not disconnected. You can revert to showing all users at any time by cleaning the text you have written in the filter.
