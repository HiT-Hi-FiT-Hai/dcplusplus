 * $Log: DCPlusPlus.cpp,v $
 * Revision 1.5  2001/12/02 23:47:35  arnetheduck
 * Added the framework for uploading and file sharing...although there's something strange about
 * the file lists...my client takes them, but not the original...
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2001/11/26 23:40:36  arnetheduck
 * Downloads!! Now downloads are possible, although the implementation is
 * likely to change in the future...more UI work (splitters...) and some bug
 * fixes. Only user file listings are downloadable, but at least it's something...
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2001/11/25 22:06:25  arnetheduck
 * Finally downloading is working! There are now a few quirks and bugs to be fixed
 * but what the heck....!
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2001/11/22 19:47:42  arnetheduck
 * A simple XML parser. Doesn't have all the features, but works good enough for
 * the configuration file.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2001/11/21 17:33:20  arnetheduck
 * Inital release
 *
 * @endif
