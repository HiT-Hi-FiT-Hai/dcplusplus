= Proposed ADC extensions

These are extensions which have been proposed but lack implementation, detail
or testing before they can be added to the real ADC spec.

=== REGX - Regular expressions in searches
This extension adds to the SCH command an additional operator RE that takes a
Perl regular expression (http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html) with full
Unicode support. Clients that support this must send "REGX" in their support
string in the INF SU field.

=== ADCS - Secure ADC <work-in-progress>
==== Introduction
Secure ADC connections can be established using a TLS tunnel, both for hub and
for client connections. Certificates can be used to authenticate both hub and
user, for example by making the hub the root CA, and only allow clients signed
by the hub to connect. Ephemeral keys should be use to ensure forward secrecy
when possible.

==== Client-Hub encryption
TLS client-hub connections can be initiated either by negotiating the feature
"ADCS" on connection or by using the protocol adcs:// when initiating the
connection. Hubs can choose to request a certificate for the user on login,
and use this certificate to replace password-based login.

==== Client-Client encryption
TLS client-client connections can be established either by negotiating the
feature "ADCS" on connection or by specifying "ADCS/1.0" in the CTM protocol
field. Clients supporting encrypted connections must indicate this in the INF
SU field with "ADCS"
